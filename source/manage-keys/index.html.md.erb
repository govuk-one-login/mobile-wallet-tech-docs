# Manage keys

GOV.UK Wallet needs to verify the validity of the credentials your service issues.

When issuing credentials in [W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) format and signing with your private keys, your credentials need to be verified by the public keys you made available in the `did:web` document.

Your public keys need to stay available through the lifecycle of your credentials. A public key used to sign a group of verifiable credentials (VCs) can not be made inactive until after the VCs have expired. You should keep public keys in an inactive state, available to be verified.

For your credential issuer service, you should include specific key management features.

Your service needs a key refresh process that creates a new asymmetric public or private key pair for signing new VCs, but that retains trust in the previous versions of the public key for verifying.

You can do this by making sure the public part of the historical key is retained, while the private key is destroyed. For example, a VC issued by an internal and external issuer.

Your service also needs key revocation. This must include a notice from the credential issuer to explain that a specific key should be removed from operational use before it expires. This will generally happen when the key is lost or compromised. If a key is compromised, it can be used by an attacker to decrypt or forge messages, impersonate an identity, or access sensitive information.

This table describes the possible states of a key pair used for signing credentials:

| Key State | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Created   | A key pair is generated with an activation date in the future. It is not yet used for signing.|
| Active    | A key becomes active on the activation date, and enabled for signing and verifying the VC. There must not be multiple keys active at the same time.|
| Inactive  | A key becomes inactive past its expiration date or time. The public key will still be valid for verifying the VC.|
| Revoked   | A key is destroyed and removed from the issuerâ€™s server, and is not valid for signing or verifying the signatures.|
