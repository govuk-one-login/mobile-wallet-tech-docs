# Issuing credentials

Once you have completed Steps 1 to 7 in the **[Setting up your service](/set-up-your-service.html)** and implemented the **[Wallet Credential Issuer APIs](/API-reference.html)**, you are ready to issue credentials to GOV.UK Wallet.

This page will guide you through the key steps your credential issuer must follow to issue a new credential. You can see a diagram with the steps on the **[wallet technical flow diagram](/issuance-flow.html#the-wallet-technical-flow)**.

## Step 1: Your user logs in with One Login

Your service must be migrated to One Login and credentials can only be offered to authenticated users. The user is simultaneously logged in your service and the wallet to ensure only the right credential is going to the right wallet.

A `walletSubjectID` is included with the personal information of the user you obtain when they log in. This `walletSubjectID` is a pairwise identifier that will be used to prove the user logged in your service and in the wallet are the same. It is later referred to as 'rightful holder check'.


## Step 2: Your service builds a credential offer



## Step 4: Your service sends the credential to wallet
