# Issuing credentials

Once you have completed Steps 1 to 7 in the **[Setting up your service](/set-up-your-service.html)** and implemented the **[Wallet Credential Issuer APIs](/API-reference.html)**, you are ready to issue credentials to GOV.UK Wallet.

This page will guide you through the key steps your credential issuer must follow to issue a new credential. You can see a diagram with the steps on the **[wallet technical flow diagram](/issuance-flow.html#the-wallet-technical-flow)**.

## Step 1: Your user logs in with One Login



## Step 2: Your service builds a credential offer



## Step 4: Your service sends the credential to wallet
