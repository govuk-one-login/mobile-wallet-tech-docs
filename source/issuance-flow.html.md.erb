# Understanding GOV.UK Wallet’s credential exchange flow

GOV.UK Wallet helps users store and share digital versions of their government credentials, such as documents, letters, cards and emails in one place that they can trust. Government organisations who already let their users log in to services with GOV.UK One Login can also offer digital verifiable credentials (VCs) users can store in their own wallet.

This diagram shows the exchange of a credential between a government service and the GOV.UK Wallet.

#### User Authenticates with One Login to Use Your Service
1\. Your user accesses your service.

2\. Your service sends a request to the One Login GET /authorize endpoint to authenticate your user. The OIDC sign-in page will open if the user does not have an existing session they’re signed in to and the user can enter their details to authenticate.

3\. One Login redirects the user with an Authorisation Code to the redirect URI your service specified when you onboarded.

4\. Your service sends a request to the One Login POST /token endpoint to exchange the authorisation code for tokens.

5\. One Login returns an Access Token as part of the response.

6\. Your service sends a request to the One Login GET /userinfo endpoint to exchange the Access Token for User Information.

7\. One Login returns the User Information which includes the WalletSubjectID.

#### [Your Service Issues a Credential Offer]()
8\. Your service generates a Credential Offer. Included in this offer is a Pre-Authorized Code which has been signed by your service.

9\. Your service renders the Credential Offer to the user as a QR code or deep-link.

10\. The user opens the app.

11\. The app prompts the user to authenticate with One Login.

12\. The same user authenticated to your service on the browser is now also authenticated with One Login in the app.

13\. The user scans the QR code or opens the deep link to redeem the Credential Offer and communicate it to the GOV.UK Wallet.

14\. The GOV.UK Wallet sends a GET request to your [/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer endpoint to fetch your Metadata]().

15\. Your service returns its Metadata.

16\. The GOV.UK Wallet sends a POST request to the One Login /token endpoint to exchange the Pre-Authorized Code embedded in the Credential Offer for an Access Token.

17\. One Login sends a GET request to your [/.well-known/jwks.json endpoint to fetch your public keys]() to verify the signature on the Pre-Authorized Code signature issued by your service.

18\. Your service returns its public keys as a JSON Web Key Set.

19\. One Login verifies the Pre-Authorized Code content and its signature.

20\. One Login issues an Access Token that will give the GOV.UK Wallet access to your service.

21\. The GOV.UK Wallet generates a Proof of Possession for the key material.

22\. The GOV.UK Wallet sends a POST request to your /credential endpoint to request the credential. This request includes the Access Token issued by One Login (as a Bearer token the Authorization header) and the Proof of Possession generated by the GOV.UK Wallet.

#### Your Service Issues a Credential

23\. Your service sends a GET request to the One Login /.well-known/jwks.json to fetch its public keys to verify the signature on the Access Token issued by One Login.

24\. One Login returns its public keys as a JSON Web Key Set.

25\. Your service verifies the content and the signature of the Access Token and the Proof of Possession.

26\. Your service builds and signs the Credential.

27\. Your service returns the Credential to the GOV.UK Wallet.

28\. The GOV.UK Wallet sends a GET request to your /.well-known/did.json endpoint to fetch your public key represented as a DID document to verify the signature on the Credential issued by your service.
i
29\. Your service returns its DID document.

30\. The GOV.UK Wallet verifies the content and signature of the Credential.

31\. The GOV.UK Wallet stores the Credential.

32\. The GOV.UK Wallet sends a POST request to your [/notification endpoint]() to notify your service that it successfully stored or failed to store the Credential.
