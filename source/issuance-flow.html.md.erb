## [User authenticates with GOV.UK One Login to use your service](/credential-issuer-functionality/authenticating-users/#authenticating-users-with-one-login)
1\. Your user accesses your service.

2\. Your service authenticates the user with GOV.UK One Login. If the user is not signed in to an existing session, the OIDC sign in page will open so they can authenticate.

3\. GOV.UK One Login redirects the authenticated user to your redirect URI. Your redirect URI was specified when you onboarded.

4\. Your service sends a request to the GOV.UK One Login GET /userinfo endpoint to exchange the access token for user information.

5\. GOV.UK One Login returns the user information, which includes the wallet subject identifier.

There is detailed guidance on [how GOV.UK One Login works](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/how-gov-uk-one-login-works/) in the GOV.UK One Login technical documentation.

## [Your service issues a credential offer](/credential-issuer-functionality/credential-offer/#credential-offer)
6\. Your service generates a credential offer. Included in this offer is a pre-authorized code signed by your service.

7\. Your service renders the credential offer to the user as a QR code or deep-link.

8\. The user opens the app.

9\. The app prompts the user to authenticate with GOV.UK One Login.

10\. The user who authenticated with your service in a web browser is authenticated with GOV.UK One Login in the app.

11\. The user scans the QR code or opens the deep link. This action redeems the credential offer and communicates it to GOV.UK Wallet.

12\. GOV.UK Wallet sends a GET request to your /.well-known/openid-credential-issuer endpoint to fetch your metadata.

13\. Your service returns its metadata.

14\. GOV.UK Wallet sends a POST request to the GOV.UK One Login /token endpoint to exchange the pre-authorized code in the credential offer for an access token.

15\. GOV.UK One Login sends a GET request to your /.well-known/jwks.json endpoint to fetch your public keys, which verify the signature on the pre-authorized code issued by your service.

16\. Your service returns its public keys as a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS).

17\. GOV.UK One Login verifies the pre-authorized code content and its signature.

18\. GOV.UK One Login issues an access token that gives GOV.UK Wallet access to your service.

19\. GOV.UK Wallet generates a proof of possession for the key material.

20\. GOV.UK Wallet sends a POST request to your /credential endpoint to request the credential. This request includes the access token issued by GOV.UK One Login (as a bearer token in the authorization header) and the proof of possession generated by GOV.UK Wallet.

## [Your service issues a credential](/credential-issuer-functionality/credential/#credential)
21\. Your service sends a GET request to the GOV.UK One Login /.well-known/jwks.json to fetch its public keys, which verify the signature on the access token issued by GOV.UK One Login.

22\. GOV.UK One Login returns its public keys as a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS).

23\. Your service verifies the content and signature of the access token and the proof of possession.

24\. Your service builds and signs the credential.

25\. Your service returns the credential to GOV.UK Wallet.

26\. GOV.UK Wallet sends a GET request to your /.well-known/did.json endpoint to fetch your DID document. The DID document contains your public key which is required to verify the signature on the credential issued by your service.

27\. Your service returns its DID document.

28\. GOV.UK Wallet verifies the content and signature of the credential.

29\. GOV.UK Wallet stores the credential.

30\. GOV.UK Wallet sends a POST request to your /notification endpoint to notify your service. This notification will confirm whether GOV.UK Wallet successfully stored the credential, or failed to store it.

31\. Your service records the notification.

32\. Your service returns an empty response to GOV.UK Wallet.
