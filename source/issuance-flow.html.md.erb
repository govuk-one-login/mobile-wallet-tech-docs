# Understanding GOV.UK digital wallet’s credential exchange flow

## The wallet logical flow

<img src="/images/wallet-logical-flow.png" width="100" height="200">

1. After a user has logged in to their GOV.UK One Login account, your government service offers a new document for the GOV.UK One Login digital wallet.

2. The wallet checks the user is also logged into the GOV.UK One Login mobile app.

3. One Login confirms the document belongs to the user who is logged in.

4. The wallet requests the document from your service.

5. Your service sends the document to GOV.UK One Login, which then sends the document on to the wallet, where it is saved.

## The wallet technical flow

GOV.UK One Login digital wallet helps users store and share digital versions of their government credentials, such as documents, letters, cards and emails in one place that they can trust. Government organisations who already let their users log in to services with GOV.UK One Login can also offer digital verifiable credentials (VCs) users can store in their own wallet.

This diagram shows a simple example of the exchange of a credential between a government service and the GOV.UK One Login digital wallet. A user who is logged into the GOV.UK One Login service starts the exchange through the GOV.UK One Login mobile app. The flow is an exchange of a credential represented as a JSON Web Token (JWT), as well as its metadata, using OAuth protected endpoints.
