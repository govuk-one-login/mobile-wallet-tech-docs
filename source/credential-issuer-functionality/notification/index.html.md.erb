# Notification

The Credential Issuer can implement the `notification_endpoint`, an optional endpoint defined in the [OID4VCI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-metadata) specification where the wallet can send notifications to the Credential Issuer about the Credentials it has issued.

The Wallet can send notifications to the Credential Issuer's notification endpoint about events such as:

- the Credential issued by the Credential Issuer has been successfully stored in the Wallet
- the Credential issued by the Credential Issuer could not be stored in the Wallet because it is invalid
- the user has taken specific actions related to the offered Credential

The notification endpoint URL is typically provided by the Credential Issuer in its Metadata, and the Wallet uses this URL to send HTTP POST requests with notification payloads.
