# Notification

The credential issuer can implement the `notification_endpoint`, an optional endpoint defined in the [OID4VCI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-metadata) specification where the GOV.UK Wallet can send notifications to the credential issuer about the credentials it has issued.

The GOV.UK Wallet can send notifications to the credential issuer's notification endpoint about events such as:

- the credential issued by the credential issuer has been successfully stored in the GOV.UK Wallet
- the credential issued by the credential issuer could not be stored in the GOV.UK Wallet because it is invalid
- the user has taken specific actions related to the offered credential

The notification endpoint URL is typically provided by the credential issuer in its metadata, and the GOV.UK Wallet uses this URL to send HTTP POST requests with notification payloads.
