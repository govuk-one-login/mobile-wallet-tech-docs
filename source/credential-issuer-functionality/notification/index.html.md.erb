# Notification

The credential issuer notification endpoint is an optional endpoint defined in the [OID4VCI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-notification-endpoint) specification. GOV.UK Wallet uses this endpoint to notify the credential issuer of events relating to issued credentials.

Notifications can be sent about events such as:

- the credential has been successfully stored in the GOV.UK Wallet
- the credential could not be stored in the GOV.UK Wallet because it is invalid
- the user has taken specific actions related to the offered credential, such as declining to save it

In order for GOV.UK Wallet to send notifications, the credential issuer must include a unique `notification_id` parameter in each [credential response](/credential-issuer-functionality/credential/#credential-response).

## Technical details

### Endpoint location

The notification endpoint's location is implementation-specific within the OID4VCI specification.

The credential issuer must publish the location of their notification endpoint in their [metadata](/credential-issuer-functionality/metadata/api.html#well-known-openid-credential-issuer) using the `notification_endpoint` parameter.

### Request format

The notification endpoint must accept HTTP POST requests.

#### Authorization header

The request must include an access token issued by GOV.UK One Login as a bearer token in the Authorization header. This is the same as the access token used for authorizing the issuance of a verifiable credential. The credential issuer must validate this access token to make sure that:

- the access token was issued by GOV.UK One Login
- the request is from the expected user

To validate the access token, you should complete the following steps.

Verify the access token signature:

- retrieve the GOV.UK One Login JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) from their JWKS endpoint
- compare the `kid` (key ID) parameter in the access token header with the `kid` values in the retrieved JWKS
- ensure the `alg` (algorithm) parameter in the access token header corresponds to the algorithm specified for the matching public key found in the JWKS
- cryptographically verify the signature on the access token using the matching public key from the JWKS and the specified algorithm

Validate the header parameters by making sure that:

- the `typ` (Type) parameter is `"at+jwt"`

Validate the payload claims by verifying that:

- the value of the `iss` (issuer) claim matches GOV.UK One Login URL: `"https://token.integration.account.gov.uk"` (integration) or `"https://token.account.gov.uk"` (production)
- the value of the `aud` (audience) claim is the same client ID you received when you registered your service to use GOV.UK One Login
- the value of the `sub` (subject - this is the wallet subject identifier) claim matches the value stored in your cache for this specific credential issuance flow
- the value of the `credential_identifiers` claim matches the value stored in your cache for this specific credential issuance flow
- this API has not received another access token with the same `jti` (JWT ID) that is still within its validity period

#### Request body

The request body must be in JSON format and contain the following parameters:

| Parameter            | Description                                                                                                                             | Value(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `notification_id`    | A string (this could be a UUID) received in the credential response, uniquely identifying an individual credential issuance occurrence. |
| `event`              | A case-sensitive string indicating the credential's status.                                                                             | One of the following enums:<br>`credential_accepted` (GOV.UK Wallet accepted the credential)<br>`credential_failure` (GOV.UK Wallet rejected the credential)<br>`credential_deleted` (user declined or deleted the credential) |
| `event_description`  | An optional parameter that GOV.UK Wallet may include to provide additional information about the event.                                 |

The credential issuer must validate the contents of the request body and should ignore any unrecognised parameters.

Below is an example of a notification when a credential is successfully stored in the GOV.UK Wallet:

```
{
  "notification_id": "776aefd4-26c6-4a5f-aa7c-b5e294cd87cd",
  "event": "credential_accepted",
  "event_description": "Credential has been successfully stored"
}
```

More information about the notification request can be found in the [OID4VCI specification] (https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#section-10.1).

### Response format

When a notification is processed successfully, the credential issuer should return a 204 No Content HTTP status code.

If the notification could not be processed successfully, the credential issuer must return an appropriate HTTP error status code.

When the notification request does not include an access token or the access token is invalid, the notification endpoint must return an [error response as defined in RFC6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-3).

When the `notification_id` value is invalid, the notification endpoint must return a 400 Bad Request HTTP status code and a response body in JSON format containing the following parameter:

- `error`: A case-sensitive string indicating the error - `invalid_notification_id` (the request's `notification_id` was invalid), or `invalid_notification_request` (the request was invalid)

Below is an example of a notification error response when the notification request included an invalid `notification_id`:

```
{
  "error": "invalid_notification_id"
}
```

More information about the error notification responses can be found in the [OID4VCI specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#section-10.3).

### Idempotency

The notification endpoint must be implemented idempotently. Identical requests with the same `notification_id` should always return the same response.
