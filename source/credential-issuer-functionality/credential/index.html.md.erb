# Credential

<b>What is it?</b> A public endpoint for the wallet to request the credential.<br><b>When do you need it?</b> This endpoint is used to send the credential to the GOV.UK Wallet. You must first establish that the wallet that requested it and the user logged in your service with One Login are allowed to receive the credential. For this, the app needs to share with you a credential issuer access token (as bearer token) and a proof that the user is in possession of the wallet.
