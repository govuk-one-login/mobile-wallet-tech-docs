# Metadata

The metadata endpoint is a required endpoint that provides essential configuration information about the credential issuer.

This endpoint lets GOV.UK Wallet and verifiers dynamically learn information about the credential issuer, such as the endpoints used in the issuance flow, the supported credential types, and how credentials should be displayed in the wallet.

## Technical details

### Endpoint location

The metadata must be publicly accessible at the standardised location `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer` on the credential issuer's domain. The data published is non-sensitive metadata about the service.

### Response format

The endpoint must return a valid JSON response that follows the [OID4VCI specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-metadata).

The metadata must include the following parameters:

- `credential_issuer`: The URL of the credential issuer.
- `authorization_servers`: An array of URLs for the authorization servers the credential issuer relies on for authorization. This must be set to the GOV.UK One Login token service URL.
- `credential_endpoint`: The URL of the credential issuer's [credential endpoint](/credential-issuer-functionality/credential/#credential), where credentials can be obtained.
- `credential_configurations_supported`: An object describing the credentials offered by the credential issuer.

If your credential issuer implements the optional [notification endpoint](/credential-issuer-functionality/notification/#notification), then the metadata must include the `notification_endpoint` parameter.

#### Credential information

The `credential_configurations_supported` object contains key/value pairs, where each key is a unique identifier of a verifiable credential supported by the credential issuer and the value is the configuration of that verifiable credential.

Each credential object in `credential_configurations_supported` must include the following parameters:

- `format`
- `credential_definition`
- `cryptographic_binding_methods_supported`
- `cryptographic_suites_supported`
- `proof_types_supported`
- `display`
- `credential_subject`

The GOV.UK Wallet also requires the credential issuer's metadata to:

- Provide English and Welsh support.
- Specify display attributes. The issuer's metadata must provide visual styling instructions and specify how fields should be named in each language. For example, when English is the selected language, the credential property `licenceNumber` must be rendered as "Fishing Licence number" [in the example below](/credential-issuer-functionality/metadata/#metadata-example).

There is more information about [the `credential_configurations_supported` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#section-11.2.3).

## Metadata example

Below is an example of how a credential issuer metadata document would represent a Fishing Licence credential:
