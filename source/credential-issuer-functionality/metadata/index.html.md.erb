# Metadata

 <b>What is it?</b> A public endpoint for the wallet to retrieve metadata about the credential(s) issued by your credential issuer.<br><b>When do you need it?</b> You must publish this metadata file once when setting up of your credential issuer service. After that, GOV.UK Wallet will retrieve your metadata at the well-known endpoint each time a user requests a new credential, in case your metadata has changed.
