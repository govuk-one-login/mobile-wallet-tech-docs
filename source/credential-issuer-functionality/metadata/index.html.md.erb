# Metadata

The metadata endpoint is a required endpoint that provides essential configuration information about the credential issuer.

This endpoint lets GOV.UK Wallet and verifiers dynamically learn information about the credential issuer, such as:

* the endpoints used in the issuance flow
* the supported credential types
* how credentials should be displayed in the wallet

## Technical details

### Endpoint location

The metadata must be publicly accessible at the standardised location `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer` on the credential issuer's domain. The data published is non-sensitive metadata about the service.

### Response format

The endpoint must return a 200 OK HTTP status code and valid JSON response that follows the [OID4VCI specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-metadata).

The metadata must include the following parameters:

- `credential_issuer`: The URL of the credential issuer.
- `authorization_servers`: An array of URLs for the authorisation servers the credential issuer relies on for authorisation. This must be set to the GOV.UK One Login URL.
- `credential_endpoint`: The URL of the credential issuer's [credential endpoint](/credential-issuer-functionality/credential/#credential), where credentials can be obtained.
- `credential_configurations_supported`: An object describing the credentials offered by the credential issuer.

If your credential issuer implements the optional [notification endpoint](/credential-issuer-functionality/notification/#notification), then the metadata must include the `notification_endpoint` parameter.

You can define and use additional metadata parameters.

#### Credential information

The `credential_configurations_supported` object contains key/value pairs, where each key is a unique identifier of a verifiable credential supported by the credential issuer and the value is the configuration of that verifiable credential.

Each credential object in `credential_configurations_supported` must include the following parameters:

- `format`
- `credential_definition`
- `cryptographic_binding_methods_supported`
- `credential_signing_alg_values_supported`
- `proof_types_supported`

There is more information about [the `credential_configurations_supported` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#section-11.2.4).

## Metadata example

Below is an example of a credential issuer metadata:

```JSON

  "credential_issuer": "https://example-credential-issuer.gov.uk",
  "authorization_servers": ["https://token.account.gov.uk"],
  "credential_endpoint": "https://example-credential-issuer.gov.uk/credential",
  "notification_endpoint": "https://example-credential-issuer.gov.uk/notification",
  "credential_configurations_supported": {
    "FishingLicenceCredential": {
      "format": "jwt_vc_json",
      "credential_definition": {
        "type": [
          "VerifiableCredential",
          "FishingLicenceCredential"
      ]},
      "cryptographic_binding_methods_supported": [
        "did"
      ],
      "credential_signing_alg_values_supported": [

      ],
      "proof_types_supported": {
        "jwt": {

        }
      }
    }
