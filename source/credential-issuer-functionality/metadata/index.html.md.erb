# Metadata

The [metadata endpoint in the OID4VCI specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-metadata) is a required endpoint that provides essential configuration information about a credential issuer. This endpoint enables wallet applications to discover an issuer's capabilities, supported credential types, and issuance parameters without prior configuration.

The metadata must be made publicly available by the credential issuer at the well-known URI `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer`, which is a standardized location defined in the specification.

# Metadata

The [metadata endpoint in the OID4VCI specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-metadata) is a required endpoint that provides essential configuration information about a credential issuer. This endpoint enables the GOV.UK Wallet and verifiers to dynamically learn information about the credential issuer, such as the issuer's capabilities, supported credential types, and issuance parameters.

The metadata must be made publicly available by the credential issuer at the well-known URI `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer`, which is a standardized location defined in the OID4VCI specification. The data published is non-sensitive metadata about the service. The response returned by the endpoint must be formatted as a JSON document.


### Required parameters
The metadata must include the following parameters:

- `credential_issuer`: The URL of the Credential Issuer
- `authorization_servers`: Array of URLs for the authorization servers the credential issuer relies on for authorization.
- `credential_endpoint`: URL where credentials can be obtained
- `credential_configurations_supported`: Array describing the credentials offered by the credential issuer







Credential issuers using GOV.UK Wallet, must produce and publish a metadata document that:

* supports English and Welsh

* controls how fields should be named in each language, for example `licenceNumber` rendered as "Fishing Licence number"

* highlights key fields visually for the user, for example document name, primary and auxiliary fields

This illustrative example shows how a credential metadata JSON file would represent a fishing licence:

```JSON

                ]

          }

```tial from a credential issuer, the GOV.UK Wallet needs to obtain credential metadata published by the organisation who issues the credential. The metadata is public, to indicate to the wallet and verifiers what credentials that issuer offers.
