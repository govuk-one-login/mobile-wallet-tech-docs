# Metadata

The [metadata endpoint in the OID4VCI specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-metadata) is a required endpoint that provides essential configuration information about the credential issuer. This endpoint enables the GOV.UK Wallet and verifiers to dynamically learn information about the credential issuer, such as the endpoints used in the issuance flow, the supported credential types, and how credentials should be displayed in the wallet.

## Technical Details

### Endpoint location

The metadata must be made publicly available by the credential issuer at the well-known URI `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer`, which is a standardized location defined in the OID4VCI specification. The data published is non-sensitive metadata about the service.

The response returned by the endpoint must be formatted as a JSON document.

### Parameters
The metadata must include the following parameters:

- `credential_issuer`: The URL of the credential issuer.
- `authorization_servers`: An array of URLs for the authorization servers the credential issuer relies on for authorization.
- `credential_endpoint`: The URL of the credential issuer's [credential endpoint](/credential-issuer-functionality/credential/#credential), where credentials can be obtained.
- `credential_configurations_supported`: An object describing the credentials offered by the credential issuer.

If your credential issuer implements the optional [notification endpoint](/credential-issuer-functionality/notification/#notification), then the metadata must include the `notification_endpoint` parameter.

### Credential information

The `credential_configurations_supported` object contains a list of key/value pairs, where each key is a unique identifier of a verifiable credential supported by the credential issuer and the value is the configuration of that verifiable credential.

Each credential object in `credential_configurations_supported` must include the following parameters:

- `format`
- `credential_definition`
- `cryptographic_binding_methods_supported`
- `cryptographic_suites_supported`
- `proof_types_supported`
- `display`
- `credential_subject`

The GOV.UK Wallet also requires the credential issuer's metadata to:

- Provide English and Welsh support.
- Specify display attributes. The issuer's metadata must provide visual styling instructions and specify how fields should be named in each language. For example, when English is the selected language, the credential property `licenceNumber` must be rendered as "Fishing Licence number" [in the example below](/credential-issuer-functionality/metadata/#metadata-example).

You can read more about the content of `credential_configurations_supported` [here](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#section-11.2.3).

## Metadata example

This illustrative example shows how a credential metadata JSON document would represent a Fishing Licence credential:
