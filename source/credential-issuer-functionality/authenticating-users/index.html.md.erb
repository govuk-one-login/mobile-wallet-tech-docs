# Authenticating users with One Login

Services that wish to issue credentials must use GOV.UK One Login authenticate their users. This ensures that any credential you issue is issued to a verified user, logged in simultaneously in your service and GOV.UK Wallet.

When you register your service with GOV.UK One Login, you get a unique client identifier. This identifier must be included as a claim (`client_id`) in the pre-authorised code your service generate as part of issuing a credential offer. There is more guidance on [issuing a credential offer](/credential-issuer-functionality/credential-offer).

When your user authenticates with GOV.UK One Login, you obtain their user information, which includes their wallet subject identifier. The wallet subject identifier is a pairwise identifier that will be used to prove that the user logged in your service and in the GOV.UK Wallet are the same user. This is referred to as the 'rightful holder check'.
