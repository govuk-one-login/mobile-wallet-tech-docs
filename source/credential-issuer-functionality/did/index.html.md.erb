# DID Document

<b>What is it?</b> A public endpoint for GOV.UK One Login and Wallet to retrieve your public keys as a DID document.<br><b>When do you need it?</b> The did:web document contains essential information such as the public signing key to verify the validity of the credential issued by your credential issuer. You must publish this did:web file when setting up your credential issuer service. After that, GOV.UK One Login and Wallet will use this endpoint to retrieve your did:web document and validate the signature of your credentials.
