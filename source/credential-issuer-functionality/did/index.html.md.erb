# DID Document

When a government organisation issues a credential to GOV.UK Wallet, it must publish public signing keys so that the wallet and verifiers can verify the validity of the credential. The public signing key for credentials is published in a decentralised identifier (DID) document. This document must include a public key of the key pairs used to sign credentials.

The DID document should be in JSON format, and contains verification methods for all credentials your service will issue. One Login uses public keys as verification methods.

The following is illustrative example of a DID document:

```JSON
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/security/suites/jws-2020/v1"
  ],
  "id": "did:web:example-credential-issuer.mobile.build.account.gov.uk",
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "id": "did:web:example-credential-issuer.mobile.build.account.gov.uk#5dcbee863b5d7cc30c9ba1f7393dacc6c16610782e4b6a191f94a7e8b1e1510f",
      "type": "JsonWebKey2020",
      "controller": "did:web:example-credential-issuer.mobile.build.account.gov.uk",
      "publicKeyJwk": {
        "kty": "EC",
        "kid": "5dcbee863b5d7cc30c9ba1f7393dacc6c16610782e4b6a191f94a7e8b1e1510f",
        "crv": "P-256",
        "x": "6jCKX_QRrmTeEJi-uiwcYqu8BgMgl70g2pdAst24MPE",
        "y": "icPzjbSk6apD_SNvQt8NWOPlPeGG4KYU55GfnARryoY",
        "alg": "ES256"
      }
    }
  ],
  "assertionMethod": [
    "did:web:example-credential-issuer.mobile.build.account.gov.uk#5dcbee863b5d7cc30c9ba1f7393dacc6c16610782e4b6a191f94a7e8b1e1510f"
  ]
}
```

* `@context` is a set of URIs that defines short-form aliases representing attributes and values in verifiable credentials.

* `id` is the decentralised identifier (DID) of your service. Because credential issuers use the `did:web` method, the general format is `"did:web:<URL OF YOUR SERVICE>"`

* `verificationMethod` is a set of verification methods that the credential issuer has implemented. Any private key used to sign credentials issued to the GOV.UK Wallet must have a corresponding public key in this array.

* `verificationMethod.id` must follow the format `"did:web:<URL OF YOUR SERVICE>#<HASHED KEY ID>"`. The value of this parameter should match the value of the `kid` parameter in the verifiable credential header so that the wallet can find the key with which to verify the credential's signature. There is more information about this in [Step 6: Define the content of your credential](/set-up-your-service.html#step-6-define-the-content-of-your-credential).

* `verificationMethod.type` indicates how a verifier can independently verify a proof. In GOV.UK One Login, we use a cryptographic public key as a verification method. Used this way, it verifies that the signer, which in this case is your government service, possesses the associated cryptographic private key. We use the JSON Web Signature 2020 specification, and the "JsonWebKey2020" type.

* `verificationMethod.controller` refers to the entity that is authorised to make changes to the DID document, i.e. your service.

* `verificationMethod.publicKeyJwk` contains your public key represented as a JWK (JSON Web Key).

A did:web document must be published on the well-known path `/.well-known/did.json` on the credential issuerâ€™s DNS hostname. The DID document above, for example, would be published at https://example-credential-issuer.mobile.build.account.gov.uk/.well-known/did.json.
