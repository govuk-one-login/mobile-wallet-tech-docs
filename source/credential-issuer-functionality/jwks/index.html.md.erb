#  JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)
The JWKS endpoint is a required endpoint that exposes the credential issuer's public cryptographic keys in JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) format.

This endpoint lets the GOV.UK One Login token service retrieve the credential issuer's public keys and then verify the [pre-authorised code](/credential-issuer-functionality/credential-offer/#the-pre-authorised-code) signature. This process confirms that the pre-authorised code was issued by the expected credential issuer and that it has not been tampered with.

## Technical details

### Endpoint location

The JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) must be publicly accessible at the standardised location `/.well-known/did.json` on the credential issuer's domain.

### Response format

The endpoint must return a valid JSON response that follows the JWKS specification defined in [RFC 7517](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517). Each key within the JWKS is represented as a JSON Web Key (JWK) object.

The JWK for an elliptic curve key based on the P-256 curve must include the following parameters:

- `kty`: The family of cryptographic algorithms used with the key - must be "EC".
- `kid`: A unique identifier for a specific key within the set - this value will be referenced in the header of pre-authorised code to indicate which key was used for signing and which key must be used for verification.

The `kid` parameter plays an important role in associating the correct public key with the pre-authorized code being verified.

- `crv`: Cryptographic curve used with the key - must be "P-256".
- `x`: The "x" coordinate for the elliptic curve point.
- `y`: The "y" coordinate for the elliptic curve point.
- `alg`: The cryptographic algorithm used with the key - must be "ES256".
- `use`: The intended use of the key - must be "sig" to indicate a signing key.

## JWKS example

Below is an example of a JWKS containing one elliptic curve key based on the P-256 curve:

```JSON
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "EC",
      "use": "sig",
      "crv": "P-256",
      "kid": "5dcbee863b5d7cc30c9ba1f7393dacc6c16610782e4b6a191f94a7e8b1e1510f",
      "x": "6jCKX_QRrmTeEJi-uiwcYqu8BgMgl70g2pdAst24MPE",
      "y": "icPzjbSk6apD_SNvQt8NWOPlPeGG4KYU55GfnARryoY",
      "alg": "ES256"
    }
  ]
}
```
