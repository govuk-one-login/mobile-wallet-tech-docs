#  JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)

The credential exchange is secured by a pre-authorised code generated by the credential and verified by One Login. The pre-authorised code is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that needs to follow specifications set by One Login. Following the specifications in the example below will allow One Login to verify that your pre-authorised code has been cryptographically signed by your credential issuer.

The signing key pair used for the pre-authorised code is the same as the signing key pair for credentials albeit in a different format. The pre-authorised code signing key pair must be in JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) format and must be published on the well-known path `/.well-known/jwks.json` on the credential issuerâ€™s DNS hostname.

For example, the `jwks.json` file featured in the example would be published at https://test-www.tax.service.gov.uk/hmrc-govwallet-did/.well-known/jwks.json

The following illustrative example shows the `jwks.json` allowing One Login to verify the validity of the pre-authorised code.

```JSON
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "EC",
      "use": "sig",
      "crv": "P-256",
      "kid": "5dcbee863b5d7cc30c9ba1f7393dacc6c16610782e4b6a191f94a7e8b1e1510f",
      "x": "6jCKX_QRrmTeEJi-uiwcYqu8BgMgl70g2pdAst24MPE",
      "y": "icPzjbSk6apD_SNvQt8NWOPlPeGG4KYU55GfnARryoY",
      "alg": "ES256"
    }
  ]
}
```

Finally, your credential issuer must expose a public `/.well-known/jwks.json` endpoint for One Login to retrieve the JWKS.
