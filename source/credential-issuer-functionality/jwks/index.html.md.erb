#  JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)

The JWKS endpoint is a required endpoint that exposes the credential issuer's public key(s) represented as JSON Web Keys (JWKs). This endpoint enables the GOV.UK One Login token service to retrieve the credential issuer's public key that verifies the signature of the [pre-authorised code](/credential-issuer-functionality/credential-offer/#the-pre-authorised-code).

## Technical details

### Endpoint location

The JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) must be made publicly available by the credential issuer at the well-known URI `/.well-known/jwks.json`, which is a standardized location.

The response returned by the endpoint must be formatted as a JSON document.

### Parameters
The metadata must include the following parameters:

- `kty`: The family of cryptographic algorithms used with the key - must be 'EC'
- `kid`: An unique identifier to match a specific key within a set
- `crv`: Cryptographic curve used with the key - must be 'P-256'
- `x`: The “x” coordinate for the elliptic curve point
- `y`: The “y” coordinate for the elliptic curve point
- `alg`: The cryptographic algorithm used with the key - must be 'ES256'
- `use`: The intended use of the key - must be 'sig'

There is more information about [JWKs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517).



The credential exchange is secured by a pre-authorised code generated by the credential and verified by One Login. The pre-authorised code is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that needs to follow specifications set by One Login. Following the specifications in the example below will allow One Login to verify that your pre-authorised code has been cryptographically signed by your credential issuer.

The signing key pair used for the pre-authorised code is the same as the signing key pair for credentials albeit in a different format. The pre-authorised code signing key pair must be in JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) format and must be published on the well-known path `/.well-known/jwks.json` on the credential issuer’s DNS hostname.


The following illustrative example shows the `jwks.json` allowing One Login to verify the validity of the pre-authorised code.

```JSON
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "EC",
      "use": "sig",
      "crv": "P-256",
      "kid": "5dcbee863b5d7cc30c9ba1f7393dacc6c16610782e4b6a191f94a7e8b1e1510f",
      "x": "6jCKX_QRrmTeEJi-uiwcYqu8BgMgl70g2pdAst24MPE",
      "y": "icPzjbSk6apD_SNvQt8NWOPlPeGG4KYU55GfnARryoY",
      "alg": "ES256"
    }
  ]
}
```

Finally, your credential issuer must expose a public `/.well-known/jwks.json` endpoint for One Login to retrieve the JWKS.
