# Before you issue a credential

When you are preparing to issue a credential to GOV.UK One Login digital wallet, it is important to think about basic good practice. If you follow this documentation and [its sample reference material](/use-sample-reference-material.html) carefully, you will be able to:

* align with open standards, particularly [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) for the credential itself, and [OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credential Issuance](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) (OIDC4VCI) for the issuance flow

* meet the requirements of the government [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), for example making all information available in Welsh

* use findings identified by your user research, for example how credentials will be presented in GOV.UK digital wallet to best meet your users' needs

To help you achieve best practice, we suggest combining:

* a common JWT payload structure for VCs across credential issuers, with a dedicated section for credential-specific attributes

* a metadata file managed by credential issuers that instructs how given attributes for the digital wallet should be named and rendered, and in which languages

We recommend the approach in the [OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credential Issuance](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) standard. The **[Understanding GOV.UK One Login digital walletâ€™s credential exchange flow](/issuance-flow.html)** section offers examples of a metadata file and JWT payload.
