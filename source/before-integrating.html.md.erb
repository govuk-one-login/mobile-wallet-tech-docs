# Before you issue a credential

Before you can issue a credential, you should do the following.

## Onboard with GOV.UK One Login

GOV.UK Wallet uses GOV.UK One Login to authenticate users. This process makes sure that credentials are issued to a verified user who is logged in to both your service and GOV.UK Wallet at the same time.

You must complete the onboarding process for GOV.UK One Login before you can issue credentials to GOV.UK Wallet. There is [guidance on the GOV.UK One Login onboarding process in their technical documentation](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/).

When you complete the GOV.UK One Login onboarding process, make sure that you have:

* your unique client identifier - this identifier must be included as a claim (`client_id`) in the pre-authorised code your service generates as part of issuing a GOV.UK Wallet credential offer
* requested that  the `walletSubjectId` custom claim is activated for your One Login client  - this is a pairwise identifier that will be used to prove that the user logged in to your service and GOV.UK Wallet are the same user

## Agree a credential template

Before you can issue a credential, you must confirm with the GOV.UK Wallet onboarding team:

* the credential type - this can be [mDoc](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec:18013:-5:ed-1:v1:en) or [JWT VC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/)
* which attributes are to be included in the digital credential and its schema
* the colour of the digital card
* whether users can have multiple instances of this credential, or only one at a time

To integrate with GOV.UK Wallet you must send the GOV.UK Wallet team:

* your issuer URL (both integration and production)
* your issuer logo in English and Welsh

## Follow relevant standards

When you are preparing to issue a credential to GOV.UK Wallet you must align with open standards

GOV.UK Wallet follows the [W3C verifiable credentials specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) to accept digital documents in the form of verifiable credentials. These documents can be: 

* [mDoc credentials](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec:18013:-5:ed-1:v1:en)
* [VC based credentials](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/)

GOV.UK Wallet supports [OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OIDC4VCI)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) for its issuance flow.

You should also:

* follow the government [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), for example making all information available in Welsh
* use findings identified by your user research to meet your usersâ€™ needs

To get started, you need to [authenticate users with One Login](credential-issuer-functionality/authenticating-users).
