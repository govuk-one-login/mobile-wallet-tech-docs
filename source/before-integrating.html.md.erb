# Before you issue a credential

Before you can issue a credential, you should do the following.

## Onboard with GOV.UK One Login

GOV.UK Wallet uses GOV.UK One Login to authenticate users. This process makes sure that credentials are issued to a verified user who is logged in to both your service and GOV.UK Wallet at the same time.

You must complete the onboarding process for GOV.UK One Login before you can issue credentials to GOV.UK Wallet. There is [guidance on the GOV.UK One Login onboarding process in their technical documentation](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/).

When you complete the GOV.UK One Login onboarding process, make sure that you have:

* your unique client identifier - this identifier must be included as a claim (`client_id`) in the pre-authorised code your service generates as part of issuing a GOV.UK Wallet credential offer
* requested that  the `walletSubjectId` be activated - this is a pairwise identifier that will be used to prove that the user logged in to your service and GOV.UK Wallet are the same user

## Agree a credential template

Before you can issue a credential, you must confirm with the GOV.UK Wallet onboarding team:

* the credential type - this can be [mDoc](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec:18013:-5:ed-1:v1:en) or [JWT VC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/)
* which attributes are to be included in the digital credential and its schema
* the colour of the digital card
* whether users can have multiple instances of this credential, or only one at a time

You must send the GOV.UK Wallet team:

* your issuer URL (both integration and production)
* your issuer logo in English and Welsh

## Follow relevant standards

When you are preparing to issue a credential to GOV.UK Wallet, you should:

* align with open standards, especially [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) for the credential itself, and [OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OIDC4VCI)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) for the issuance flow
* follow the government [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), for example making all information available in Welsh
* use findings identified by your user research to meet your users’ needs

To help you achieve best practice, you could use:

* a common JWT payload structure for VCs across credential issuers, with a dedicated section for credential-specific attributes
* a metadata file managed by credential issuers that instructs how given attributes for the digital wallet should be named and rendered, and in which languages

There are examples of a metadata file and JWT payload in the [understanding GOV.UK Wallet’s credential exchange flow](issuance-flow) section.

To get started, you need to [authenticate users with One Login](credential-issuer-functionality/authenticating-users).
