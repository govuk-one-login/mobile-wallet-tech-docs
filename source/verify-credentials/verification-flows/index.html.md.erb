# Verify credentials in GOV.UK Wallet

GOV.UK Wallet will let users share their credentials:

- [in person](consuming-and-verifying-credentials/verify-credentials/verify-in-person) - for example, to prove their age when purchasing age-restricted products
- [online](consuming-and-verifying-credentials/verify-credentials/verify-online) - for example, to share documents with a service securely instead of uploading a photo or a PDF

GOV.UK Wallet will first enable [in-person sharing](consuming-and-verifying-credentials/verify-credentials/verify-in-person) in line with [ISO/IEC 18013-5](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec:18013:-5:ed-1:v1:en). In the future, we’ll add remote flows, and more details about OID4VP profiles.
