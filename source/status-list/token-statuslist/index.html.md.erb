# Checking a credential's status in Token status list

The Status List service hosts all status lists publicly. Each list is a signed JWT. You can verify the JWT's signature by accessing the Status List service's JWKS hosted at `https://crs.account.gov.uk/.well-known/jwks.json` (production) or `https://crs.integration.account.gov.uk/.well-known/jwks.json` (integration).

You can use the status list `uri` in the credential to check a credential's status.

The status lists beginning with `/t/` are [Token status lists](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-status-list-12.html) JWT payload.
Each status at a specific index in the status list uses 2 bits.
Each status index may contain one of the following bit combinations:

* `00` (VALID). Represents a valid credential
* `01` (INVALID). Represents a credential that has been revoked (marked as invalid)
* `10` (NOT USED). Currently not used.
* `11` (NOT USED). Currently not used.

## Technical details

### Endpoint URI

The URI path for the Token status list endpoint is `/t/{endpoint}`. It is presented as a GET request, where:

* `b` represents the type of status list for this shard `TokenStatusList`
* `endpoint` represents an ID for a specific status list

### Request Example
The following is an example of the `/t/{endpoint}` request:

```TEXT
GET /t/A671FED3E9AD HTTP/1.1
Host: crs.account.gov.uk
Accept: application/statuslist+jwt
```
### Request Response

#### Header

The JWT response header will contain the following:

```JSON
{
  "alg": "ES256",
  "kid": "12",
  "typ": "statuslist+jwt"
}
```

| Parameter | Description           |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| `alg`     | `alg` stands for 'algorithm'. This value will be returned as `ES256`. This is the algorithm used to encode the JWT.    |
| `kid`     | `kid` stands for 'key ID'. This key ID represents a key in the Status List service's JWKS which can be used to verify the JSON web signature (JWS).    |
| `typ`     | `typ` stands for 'type'. This is the type of the status list. It can be `statuslist+jwt` (token) or `vc+jwt` (bitstring).    |

#### Payload

The JWT response payload for a Token status list will contain the following:

```JSON
{
  "exp": 2291720170,
  "iat": 1686920170,
  "iss": "https://crs.account.gov.uk",
  "status_list": {
    "bits": 2,
    "lst": "eNpzdAEAAMgAhg"
  },
  "sub": "https://crs.account.gov.uk/b/A671FED3E9AD",
  "ttl": 43200
}
```

| Parameter | Description           |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| `exp`     | `exp` stands for 'expiry'. This is the expiry of the subject credential.    |
| `iat`     | `iat` stands for 'issued at'. This is the timestamp the subject credential was originally issued at.    |
| `iss`     | `iss` stands for 'issuer'. This is the URL of the credential issuer service operated by the organisation sharing the credential.    |
| `status_list.bits` | The number of bits that represent a status.    |
| `status_list.lst` | `lst` stands for 'list'. This is an encoded version of this shard of the status list.    |
| `sub` | `sub` stands for 'subject'. This is the URI of the shard that was in the original HTTP request.    |
| `ttl` | `ttl` stands for 'time-to-live'. This is the lifetime of the cached version of this shard. Shards are updated at regular and set intervals.    |
