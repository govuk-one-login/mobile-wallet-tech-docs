# Before you issue a status record

To issue credentials with a status, you must register with the Status List service. To do this, speak with your GOV.UK Wallet engagement manager or [contact us](contact-us).

When you register with the Status List service, you get a unique `clientId`. You must include this `clientId` identifier as [the `iss` claim](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1) in the JWTs you send to the [`/issue`](../issue-status-list-entry) and [`/revoke`](../revoke-credential) endpoints.

<!---
clientId determines which type of status list your status is assigned to, bitstring or token
If you need both formats you'll get 2 clientIds because the association is direct
Regardless of type, requests and responses are same format
Your responsibility to make sure they're included in your credentials in the right way
