# Before you issue a status record

To issue credentials with a status, you must register with the Status List service. To do this, speak to your GOV.UK Wallet engagement manager or [contact us](contact-us).

When you register with the Status List service, you get a unique `clientId`. You must include this `clientId` identifier as [the `iss` claim](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1) in the JWTs you send to the [`/issue`](../issue-status-list-entry) and [`/revoke`](../revoke-credential) endpoints.

Your `clientId` determines whether your status is assigned to a Token or Bitstring status list. If you need to use both status list formats you will get 2 `clientId`s, because the association between `clientId` and the status list is direct.

The requests to and responses from the status list are the same, regardless of the status list type. You must make sure the status list responses are included in your credential correctly.
