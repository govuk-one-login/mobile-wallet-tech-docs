# Before you issue a status record

To issue credentials with a status, you must register with the Status List service. To do this, speak with your GOV.UK Wallet engagement manager or [contact us](contact-us).

When you register with the Status List service, you get a unique `clientId`. You must include this `clientId` identifier as a claim in the JWTs you send to the [`/issue`](../issue-status-list-entry) and [`/revoke`](../revoke-credential) endpoints.
