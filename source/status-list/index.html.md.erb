# Credential status list

The credential status list service provides:

* an issuer-facing API that credential issuers can use to change a credential's status 
* a public-facing credential status API that anyone can use to check a credential's status


As a credential issuer, you can use the issuer-facing API to issue a unique `index` and `uri` which can be embedded into a new credential when issued to GOV.UK Wallet. You can set the status of this issued slot as `revoked` if you need to revoke a credential in future.

Anyone, including credential verifiers and holders, can use the public-facing credential status API to get a complete status list and check a credential's status.

In this section you can find information about:

* [issuing a status record](issue-status-list-entry/)
* [revoking a credential](revoke-credential/)
* [checking a credential's status](statuslist/)
