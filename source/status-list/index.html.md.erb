# Credential Status List

The Credential Status List service provides two distinct services, an issuer-facing API and a public-facing verfication API.


The issuer-facing API allows credential issuers to issue a unique `index` and `uri` which can be embedded into a new credential when issued to a wallet.
The status of this issued slot can then be set as `revoked` at a future date if required.

The public-facing verfication API can be used by anyone to get a complete status list, though this service is expected to be used by verifiers and holders.

In this section you can find information about:

* [issuing a status list entry](issue-status-list-entry/)
* [revoking a credential](revoke-credential/)
* [getting a status list](statuslist/)
