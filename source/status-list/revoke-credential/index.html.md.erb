# Revoke Credential

As a credential issuer, you can call the `/revoke` endpoint to revoke credentials you have previously issued. You cannot use it to revoke credentials issued by anyone else.

GOV.UK Wallet validates all calls to the `/revoke` endpoint to make sure that the caller has the correct rights to revoke the credential.

When you call the `/revoke` endpoint on an existing and valid credential, that credential is marked internally as invalid. It will be marked as invalid in its status list entry within a known timeframe. There is [more guidance on this in the statuslist endpoint page](statuslist/).

### Technical details

#### Endpoint URI

The URI path for the revoke credential endpoint is `/revoke`.

When you register as a credential issuer, you get access to the internal API. You must sign the request with your private key and share public keys on your `/.well-known/jwks.json`. This is used to verify the jwt.

#### Request format

The revoke endpoint must accept HTTP POST requests.

The request must include:

* `header`: Authorization header including a kid, alg and type (JWT), which is signed and encoded
* `request body`: contains a signed jwt including `idx` (the index of the credential to revoke) and `iss`(the credential issuer uri)


### Request Example

#### Header

The JWT header must contain the following parameters:

```JSON
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "ES256",
  "kid": "499b46712489a805510bdf3e61e1f93d"
}
```
* `typ` must be "JWT" - this is the media type of the complete JWT
* `alg` (algorithm). REQUIRED. must be "ES256" - this is the algorithm used to sign the JWT
* `kid` (key ID). REQUIRED. This key ID must match the key ID used when registering as a credential issuer for the status list. This is used as part of the verification process

#### Payload

The JWT payload must contain the following parameters:

```JSON
{
  "iss": "asKWnsjeEJEWjjwSHsIksIksIhBe",
  "idx": 3,
  "uri": "https://crs.account.gov.uk/t/3B0F3BD087A7"
}
```
* `iss` (issuer). REQUIRED. The URL of the credential issuer service operated by the organisation sharing the credential
* `idx` (index). REQUIRED. The index of the credential to be revoked
* `uri` (status list). REQUIRED. The status list shard this credential belongs to

You can find `idx` and `uri` in the response from the [`/issue` endpoint](/status-list/issue-status-list-entry).
