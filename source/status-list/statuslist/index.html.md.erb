# Status List
The status list endpoint gives GOV.UK Wallet holders and verifiers access to shards of status list values. 
Each shard holds a number of indexes that have been allocated to credentials by issuers.

Each status may contain one of the following values:

* `0x00` (VALID). Represents a valid credential
* `0x01` (INVALID). Represents a credential that has been revoked (marked as invalid)
* `0x10` (NOT USED). Currently not used.
* `0x11` (NOT USED). Currently not used.

## Technical details

### Endpoint URI
The URI path for the statuslist endpoint is `/{type}/{endpoint}` and is presented as  GET request.

Where:

* `type` represents the type of status list for this shard (`b` for `BitstringStatusList` or `t` for `TokenStatusList`)
* `endpoint` represents the hashed ID of a shard

The statuslist endpoint is a public facing API, which can be used by any GOV.UK Wallet holder or verifier, or any other body that have a particular shard they wish to retrieve


### Request Example
The following is an example of the `/{type}/{endpoint}` request:

```TEXT
GET /b/A671FED3E9AD HTTP/1.1
Host: api.status-list.service.gov.uk
Accept: application/statuslist+jwt
```
### Request Response

#### Header

The JWT response header will contain the following:

```JSON
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "kid": "12",
  "typ": "statuslist+jwt"
}
```

* `alg` (algorithm). Will be "HS256" - this is the algorithm used to encode the JWT
* `kid` (key ID). REQUIRED. This key ID must match the key ID used when registering as a credential issuer for the status list. This is used as part of the verification process
* `type` (status list type). The type of the status list (token status list or bitstring status list)

#### Payload

The JWT response payload will contain the following:

```JSON
{
  "exp": 2291720170,
  "iat": 1686920170,
  "iss": "https://api.status-list.service.gov.uk",
  "status_list": {
    "bits": 2,
    "lst": "eNpzdAEAAMgAhg"
  },
  "sub": "https://api.status-list.service.gov.uk/b/A671FED3E9AD",
  "ttl": 43200
}
```

* `exp` (expiry). The expiry of the subject credential
* `iat` (issued at). The timestamp the subject credential was originally issued at
* `iss` (issuer). The URL of the credential issuer service operated by the organisation sharing the credential
* `status_list.bits` (bits). The number of bits that represent a status
* `status_list.lst` (list). An encoded version of this shard of the status list
* `sub` (algorithm). The URI of the shard present in the original HTTP request
* `ttl` (time-to-live). The lifetime of the cached version of this shard. Shards are updated at regular and set intervals
