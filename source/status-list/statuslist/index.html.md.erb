# Check a credential's status

You can use the status list endpoint to check the status of an issued credential. It is a public facing API that can be used by anyone to retrieve shards from the status list.

Shards are used to break down the status list into multiple lists to save space. Each shard holds a number of indexes that have been allocated to credentials by issuers. To preserve privacy, the status list randomly selects which shard an index is issued from.

Each status may contain one of the following values:

* `0x00` (VALID). Represents a valid credential
* `0x01` (INVALID). Represents a credential that has been revoked (marked as invalid)
* `0x10` (NOT USED). Currently not used.
* `0x11` (NOT USED). Currently not used.

## Technical details

### Endpoint URI

The URI path for the status list endpoint is `/{type}/{endpoint}`. It is presented as a GET request, where:

* `type` represents the type of status list for this shard (`b` for `BitstringStatusList` or `t` for `TokenStatusList`)
* `endpoint` represents the hashed ID of a shard

### Request Example
The following is an example of the `/{type}/{endpoint}` request:

```TEXT
GET /b/A671FED3E9AD HTTP/1.1
Host: crs.account.gov.uk
Accept: application/statuslist+jwt
```
### Request Response

#### Header

The JWT response header will contain the following:

```JSON
{
  "alg": "ES256",
  "kid": "12",
  "typ": "statuslist+jwt"
}
```

* `alg` (algorithm). Will be "ES256" - this is the algorithm used to encode the JWT
* `kid` (key ID). REQUIRED. This key ID must match the key ID used when registering as a credential issuer for the status list. This is used as part of the verification process
* `type` (status list type). The type of the status list (token status list or bitstring status list)

#### Payload

The JWT response payload will contain the following:

```JSON
{
  "exp": 2291720170,
  "iat": 1686920170,
  "iss": "https://crs.account.gov.uk",
  "status_list": {
    "bits": 2,
    "lst": "eNpzdAEAAMgAhg"
  },
  "sub": "https://crs.account.gov.uk/b/A671FED3E9AD",
  "ttl": 43200
}
```

* `exp` (expiry). The expiry of the subject credential
* `iat` (issued at). The timestamp the subject credential was originally issued at
* `iss` (issuer). The URL of the credential issuer service operated by the organisation sharing the credential
* `status_list.bits` (bits). The number of bits that represent a status
* `status_list.lst` (list). An encoded version of this shard of the status list
* `sub` (path). The URI of the shard present in the original HTTP request
* `ttl` (time-to-live). The lifetime of the cached version of this shard. Shards are updated at regular and set intervals
