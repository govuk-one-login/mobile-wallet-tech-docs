# Checking a credential's status in a status list

The Status List service hosts all status lists publicly. Each list is a signed JWT. You can verify the JWT's signature by accessing the Status List service's JWKS hosted at `https://crs.account.gov.uk/.well-known/jwks.json` (production) or `https://crs.integration.account.gov.uk/.well-known/jwks.json` (integration).

You can use the status list `uri` in the credential to check a credential's status.

The status lists beginning with `/b/` in path are [Bitstring status lists](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/) JWT payload.
For consistency between the two different lists that the status list service publishes it uses the more [complex implementation of Bitstring status list](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/#example-example-statuslistcredential-using-more-complex-entries).

Each status at a specific index in the status list uses 2 bits.
Each status index may contain one of the following bit combinations:

* `00` (VALID). Represents a valid credential
* `01` (INVALID). Represents a credential that has been revoked (marked as invalid)
* `10` (NOT USED). Currently not used.
* `11` (NOT USED). Currently not used.

## Technical details

### Endpoint URI

The URI path for the Bitstring status list endpoint is `/b/{statusListIdentifier}`.
The URI path for the Token status list endpoint is `/t/{statusListIdentifier}`.

Both are presented as a GET request. The combination of status list list type and status list identifier represents a unique status list.
### Token Status List Request Example
The following is an example of the `/t/{statusListIdentifier}` request:

```TEXT
GET /t/A671FED3E9AD HTTP/1.1
Host: crs.account.gov.uk
Accept: application/statuslist+jwt
```

### Request Response

#### Header

The JWT response header will contain the following:

```JSON
{
  "alg": "ES256",
  "kid": "12",
  "typ": "statuslist+jwt"
}
```

| Parameter | Description           |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| `alg`     | `alg` stands for 'algorithm'. This value will be returned as `ES256`. This is the algorithm used to encode the JWT.    |
| `kid`     | `kid` stands for 'key ID'. This key ID represents a key in the Status List service's JWKS which can be used to verify the JSON web signature (JWS).    |
| `typ`     | `typ` stands for 'type'. This is the type of the status list. It can be `statuslist+jwt` (token) or `vc+jwt` (bitstring).    |

#### Payload

The JWT response payload for a Token status list will contain the following:

```JSON
{
  "exp": 2291720170,
  "iat": 1686920170,
  "iss": "https://crs.account.gov.uk",
  "status_list": {
    "bits": 2,
    "lst": "eNpzdAEAAMgAhg"
  },
  "sub": "https://crs.account.gov.uk/b/A671FED3E9AD",
  "ttl": 43200
}
```

| Parameter | Description           |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| `exp`     | `exp` stands for 'expiry'. This is the expiry of the subject credential.    |
| `iat`     | `iat` stands for 'issued at'. This is the timestamp the subject credential was originally issued at.    |
| `iss`     | `iss` stands for 'issuer'. This is the URL of the credential issuer service operated by the organisation sharing the credential.    |
| `status_list.bits` | The number of bits that represent a status.    |
| `status_list.lst` | `lst` stands for 'list'. This is an encoded version of this shard of the status list.    |
| `sub` | `sub` stands for 'subject'. This is the URI of the shard that was in the original HTTP request.    |
| `ttl` | `ttl` stands for 'time-to-live'. This is the lifetime of the cached version of this shard. Shards are updated at regular and set intervals.    |

### Bitstring Status List Request Example
The following is an example of the `/b/{statusListIdentifier}` request:

```TEXT
GET /b/A671FED3E9AD HTTP/1.1
Host: crs.account.gov.uk
Accept: application/json
```

### Request Response

#### Header

The JWT response header will contain the following:

```JSON
{
  "alg": "ES256",
  "kid": "12",
  "typ": "vc+jwt"
}
```

| Parameter | Description           |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| `alg`     | `alg` stands for 'algorithm'. This value will be returned as `ES256`. This is the algorithm used to encode the JWT.    |
| `kid`     | `kid` stands for 'key ID'. This key ID represents a key in the Status List service's JWKS which can be used to verify the JSON web signature (JWS).    |
| `typ`     | `typ` stands for 'type'. This is the type of the status list. It `vc+jwt` for `BitstringStatusList`.    |

#### Payload

The JWT response payload for a Token status list will contain the following:

```JSON

    "statusMessage": [
      {
        "status": "0x0",
        "message": "VALID"
      },
      {
        "status": "0x1",
        "message": "INVALID"
      }
    ],
    "encodedList": "H4sIAAAAAAAAA3MUBABJTAvCAgAAAA",
