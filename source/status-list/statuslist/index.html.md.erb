# Check a credential's status

The status list service hosts all status lists publicly. Each list is a signed JWT, and you can verify its signature by accessing the status list's JWKS hosted at `https://crs.account.gov.uk/.well-known/jwks.json`.

You can use the status list uri in the credential to check a credential's status.

The JWT payload is in 2 formats:

* status lists beginning with `/b/` are [BitString status lists](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/)
* status lists beginning with `/t/` are [Token status lists](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-status-list-12.html)

Each status may contain one of the following values:

* `0x00` (VALID). Represents a valid credential
* `0x01` (INVALID). Represents a credential that has been revoked (marked as invalid)
* `0x10` (NOT USED). Currently not used.
* `0x11` (NOT USED). Currently not used.

## Technical details

### Endpoint URI

The URI path for the status list endpoint is `/{type}/{endpoint}`. It is presented as a GET request, where:

* `type` represents the type of status list for this shard (`b` for `BitstringStatusList` or `t` for `TokenStatusList`)
* `endpoint` represents an ID for a specific status list

### Request Example
The following is an example of the `/t/{endpoint}` request:

```TEXT
GET /t/A671FED3E9AD HTTP/1.1
Host: crs.account.gov.uk
Accept: application/statuslist+jwt
```
### Request Response

#### Header

The JWT response header will contain the following:

```JSON
{
  "alg": "ES256",
  "kid": "12",
  "typ": "statuslist+jwt"
}
```

* `alg` (algorithm). Will be "ES256" - this is the algorithm used to encode the JWT
* `kid` (key ID). REQUIRED. This key ID represents a key in the status list's JWKS which can be used to verify the JSON web signature (JWS)
* `typ` (status list type). OPTIONAL. The type of the status list - statuslist+jwt (token) or vc+jwt (bitstring)

#### Payload

The JWT response payload for a token status list will contain the following:

```JSON
{
  "exp": 2291720170,
  "iat": 1686920170,
  "iss": "https://crs.account.gov.uk",
  "status_list": {
    "bits": 2,
    "lst": "eNpzdAEAAMgAhg"
  },
  "sub": "https://crs.account.gov.uk/b/A671FED3E9AD",
  "ttl": 43200
}
```

* `exp` (expiry). The expiry of the subject credential
* `iat` (issued at). The timestamp the subject credential was originally issued at
* `iss` (issuer). The URL of the credential issuer service operated by the organisation sharing the credential
* `status_list.bits` (bits). The number of bits that represent a status
* `status_list.lst` (list). An encoded version of this shard of the status list
* `sub` (path). The URI of the shard present in the original HTTP request
* `ttl` (time-to-live). The lifetime of the cached version of this shard. Shards are updated at regular and set intervals

The JWT response payload for a bitstring status list will contain the following:

```
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2"
  ],
  "id": "https://crs.account.gov.uk/b/09B0W0J5D6RC;",
  "type": [
    "VerifiableCredential",
    "BitstringStatusListCredential"
  ],
  "issuer": "https://crs.account.gov.uk",
  "validFrom": "2025-10-01T13:56:45.792Z",
  "validUntil": "2025-10-01T13:57:28.992Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "https://crs.account.gov.uk/b/09B0W0J5D6RC",
    "type": "BitstringStatusList",
    "statusSize": 2,
    "statusPurpose": "message",
    "statusMessages": [
      {
        "status": "0x0",
        "message": "VALID"
      },
      {
        "status": "0x1",
        "message": "INVALID"
      }
    ],
    "encodedList": "H4sIAAAAAAAAA+3CMQ0AAAACoEIe9k9nD8egKQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD8GxKhwqk/DAAA="
  }
}
```
