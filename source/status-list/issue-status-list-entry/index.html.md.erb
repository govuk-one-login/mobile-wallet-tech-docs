# Issuing a status list entry
You can use the issue status list entry endpoint to issue new credentials into the status list.

When you request to issue a new credential, the request is validated. If the validation is successful, a new credential will be issued on the status list. An index and uri to where this this credential's status is stored is also returned.

All new issuers must be registered, and must send the request as a signed JWT.

### Technical details

#### Endpoint URI
The URI path for the issuing endpoint is `/issue`.

When a credential issuer is registered, they are given access to the internal API. The issuer must sign the request with its private key and share public keys on its `/.well-known/jwks.json`. This is used to verify the jwt.

#### Request format
The issue endpoint must accept HTTP POST requests.

The request must include:

* `header`: Authorization header including a kid, alg and type (JWT), which is signed and encoded

* `request body (JSON)`: contains a signed jwt including "expires" (the expiry date) and “iss” (the credential issuer uri)


### Request Example

#### Header

The JWT header must contain the following parameters:

```JSON
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "ES256",
  "kid": "1fb2c0f07f643b45cafeb53fb9d9eb34"
}
```
* `typ` must be "JWT" - this is the media type of the complete JWT
* `alg` (algorithm). REQUIRED. must be "ES256" - this is the algorithm used to sign the JWT
* `kid` (key ID). REQUIRED. This key ID must match the key ID used when registering as a credential issuer for the status list. This is used as part of the verification process.

#### Payload

The JWT payload must contain the following parameters:

```JSON
{
  "iss": "https://issuer.domain.com",
  "expires": "1734709493"
}
```

* `iss` (issuer). REQUIRED. The URL of the credential issuer service operated by the organisation sharing the credential
* `expires` (expiration time). REQUIRED. The expiry date for the credential - after this date the credential will expire

This is an example of the post request signed and encrypted as a jwt:

```
POST /issue HTTP/1.1
Host: api.status-list.service.gov.uk
Accept: application/json

```

### Example Response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "idx": 3,
  "uri": "https://api.status-list.service.gov.uk/b/A671FED3E9AD"
}
```

* `idx` (index). The index at which the credential will be stored in the status list found on the uri
* `uri` (status list). The uri to the status list endpoint in which the new credential has been stored
