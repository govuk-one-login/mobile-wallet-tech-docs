# Issue a status list entry

You can use the `/issue` endpoint to request a status list slot for a credential you want to issue. This endpoint lets you retrieve a new `uri`/`idx` pair from a status list, which represents a unique credential being issued to a user's wallet.

To use the `/issue` endpoint you must [register as a credential issuer with the Status List service](/status-list/before-issuing-status-record), and you must send your request as a signed JSON Web Token (JWT).

When you request a new `uri`/`idx` pair for a credential on a status list, the Status List service validates your request. If this validation is successful, the Status List service will issue a new `uri`/`idx` pair on one of its status lists.

The Status List service will also return a uri and an index to where you can retrieve this credential's status. You must include this response in your issued credential.

For guidance on how to include the Status List Service's response in your credentials, see:

* the [Token status list specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-status-list/) for mdoc credentials
* the [BitString status list specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/) for JWT-VC credentials

### Technical details

The requests to and responses from the Status List Service are the same, regardless of the credential or status list type.

#### Endpoint URI

The URI path for the issue endpoint is `/issue`.

When you register as a credential issuer with the Status List service, you get access to the internal API. You must sign the request with your private key and share public keys on your `/.well-known/jwks.json` endpoint. This is used to verify the JWT.

#### Request format
The issue endpoint only accepts HTTP POST requests.

The request must include:

* `header`: you must provide the `Content-Type` header - the only valid value is `application/jwt`
* `request body (JWT)`: contains a signed JWT based on [RFC 7515](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515), which must follow the requirements below


### Status list JWT definition `/issue`

#### Header

The JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) header (based on [RFC-7515](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-4)) must contain the following header parameters:

```JSON
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "ES256",
  "kid": "1fb2c0f07f643b45cafeb53fb9d9eb34"
}
```

| Parameter | Required or optional | Description                                                                                                                        |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `typ`     | Required             | `typ` stands for 'type'. You must set this value to be `JWT`. This is the media type of the complete JWT.                          |
| `alg`     | Required             | `alg` stands for 'algorithm'. You must set this value to be `ES256`. This is the algorithm used to sign the JWT.                   |
| `kid`     | Required             | `kid` stands for 'key ID'. This key ID must be present in your hosted JWKS. This is used to validate the JSON web signature (JWS). |


#### Payload

The JWT payload must contain the following claims:

```JSON
{
  "iss": "exampleclientIDabcd123",

| `iss`          | Required             | `iss` stands for 'issuer'. This is the [`clientId` of the credential issuer](/status-list/before-issuing-status-record) service generated when registering as a client.<br><br>Make sure you are using the correct `clientId` for your environment - production or integration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `iat`          | Required             | `iat` stands for 'issued at'.

| `jti`          | Required             | `jti` stands for 'JWT ID'. This provides a unique identifier for the JWT. The Status List Service will validate the format provided to make sure it is a lowercase UUID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `statusExpiry` | Required             | The point after which the status expires. After this date the credential will be removed from the status list.<br><br>`statusExpiry` must be equal to or later than the issued credential's technical expiry time, known as the `validUntil` property. It may be useful to issue a status before the `validUntil` value is known. In this case, we recommend that you keep any resulting difference between `validUntil` and `statusExpiry` to a minimum.<br><br>`statusExpiry` must be a number in seconds, formatted as a UNIX timestamp. The Status List Service does not support credentials lasting over 1 year. |
