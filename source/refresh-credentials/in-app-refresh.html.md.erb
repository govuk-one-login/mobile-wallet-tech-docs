## Understand GOV.UK Wallet’s automatic in-app refresh flow

This diagram shows the exchange between a government service (the ‘credential issuer’) and GOV.UK Wallet when the user refreshes a credential with the automatic in-app method. This diagram, and the descriptions below it, are an explanation of each step in the process.
