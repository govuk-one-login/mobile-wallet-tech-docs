# Use manual credential refresh

GOV.UK Wallet lets your users get a new credential without going through the full credential issuance journey they used the first time it was issued. This is the manual credential refresh journey.

## Update credential issuer metadata

GOV.UK Wallet will prompt your users when they need to refresh their valid credential. You can read more about [credential expiry](../issue-a-credential/metadata/#credential-expiry).

When your user taps the 'Refresh' button in the app, the app will take the user to the URL you provided in your [`credential_refresh_web_journey_url` parameter](../issue-a-credential/metadata/#credential-information). This will start their credential refresh journey in their web browser. At the end of this journey, you must provide a new credential offer that GOV.UK Wallet can use to request a new credential.

You must also include the `credential_validity_period_max_days` parameter to set a maximum validity period. After this validity period, the credential must be refreshed. 

GOV.UK Wallet requires you to return `credential_refresh_web_journey_url` and `credential_validity_period_max_days` in your metadata endpoint response. These are custom parameters that are not part of the OID4VCI specification.

You must get the information about the user's existing credential from their user record. GOV.UK Wallet does not share any details about the user when they start your manual refresh journey.

If GOV.UK Wallet adds the new credential successfully, the user will only see the new credential in their documents. GOV.UK Wallet will remove the old credential.

## Understand GOV.UK Wallet's manual credential refresh flow

This diagram shows the exchange between a government service (the 'credential issuer') and GOV.UK Wallet when the user refreshes a credential. This diagram, and the descriptions below it, are an explanation of each step in the process.

1. Your user opens the app and finds the credential they need to refresh.

2. GOV.UK Wallet sends a GET request to your `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer` endpoint to fetch your credential issuer metadata.

3. Your service returns its credential issuer metadata.

4. The app finds the [`credential_refresh_web_journey_url`](../issue-a-credential/metadata/#credential-information) value in the credential issuer metadata.

5. The app validates the `credential_refresh_web_journey_url`.

6. The user selects the 'Refresh' button in the app.

7. The app opens the issuer's `credential_refresh_web_journey_url` in a browser on the user's mobile device.

When the user's browser has loaded your `credential_refresh_web_journey_url`, your service should:

1. Authenticate the user with GOV.UK One Login.

2. Determine if the user's credential can be reissued.

3. Reissue the user's credential through [the credential issuance process](/issuing-credentials-to-wallet.html#user-authenticates-with-gov-uk-one-login-to-use-your-service).
