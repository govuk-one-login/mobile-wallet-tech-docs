# Refresh credentials

GOV.UK Wallet lets your users get a new digital credential without going through the longer credential issuance journey they used the first time it was issued. This is the credential refresh journey.

## How users can refresh credentials

Your users can refresh their credentials:

- [in app](refresh-credentials/in-app-refresh), which lets your user refresh their credential without leaving the GOV.UK One Login app
- [manually](refresh-credentials/manual-refresh), which takes your user back to your service to refresh their credential

We recommend using in-app refresh as your main refresh method, as it is faster and simpler for your users.

We recommend using manual credential refresh:

- as a backup method if in-app refresh fails
- if your user's refresh token has expired
- if you need to increase your user's identity confidence to medium. There is [guidance on choosing the level of identity confidence in the GOV.UK One Login technical documentation](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/before-integrating/choose-the-level-of-identity-confidence/#choose-the-level-of-identity-confidence-for-your-service)

## When to ask users to refresh credentials

### When the credential passes its technical expiry date

Digital credentials in GOV.UK Wallet have a technical expiry date, which is when the digital version of a user's credential is no longer valid and must be updated. You must set this technical expiry date using the [`validUntil` claim](/issue-a-credential/credential/#payload) in the credential. There is [more guidance on credential expiry](/issue-a-credential/credential/#guidance-on-credential-expiration).

When a credential passes its `validUntil` date, it will fail programmatic verification and must be rejected by anyone who verifies it. The user will see their expired credential marked as 'Invalid' and greyed out in the app.

### When the user's details have changed

You can revoke a user's credential, for example because they have changed their details. When you revoke a user's credential, it will appear marked as 'Invalid' and greyed out in the app. It can take up to 8 hours for a credential to be marked as 'Invalid'. There is [guidance on revoking credentials](/status-list/revoke-credential). 

### When the user reaches a birthday where their entitlements change

When you issue a credential, you should check if the user will reach a birthday where their entitlements change (18, 21 or 25) before that credential passes its `validUntil` date. If they will, you should set the credential's `expectedUpdate` to the user's upcoming birthday. On the `expectedUpdate` date, GOV.UK Wallet will attempt to refresh their credential using in-app refreshing. The previous credential will be valid until the `validUntil` date, but any `age over {nn}` checks will fail until the user successfully refreshes their credential.

## Guidance on credentials issued before in-app refreshing

Your user may hold credentials that were issued before GOV.UK Wallet's in-app refresh was deployed. In this case, you must first ask them to refresh this credential manually before they can use in-app refreshing.
