# Refresh credentials

Digital credentials in GOV.UK Wallet have a technical expiry date, which is when the digital version of a user's credential is no longer valid and must be updated. You can set this technical expiry date using the [`validUntil` claim](/issue-a-credential/credential/#payload) in the credential. There is [more guidance on credential expiry](/issue-a-credential/credential/#guidance-on-credential-expiration).

When a credential passes its `validUntil` date, it will fail programmatic verification and must be rejected by anyone who verifies it. The user will see their expired credential marked as 'Invalid' and greyed out in the app. 

GOV.UK Wallet lets your users get a new credential without going through the longer credential issuance journey they used the first time it was issued.

Your users can refresh their credentials:

- [in app](refresh-credentials/in-app-refresh), which lets your user refresh their credential without leaving the GOV.UK One Login app
- [manually](refresh-credentials/manual-refresh), which takes your user back to your service to refresh their credential

We recommend using in-app refresh as your main refresh method, as it is faster and simpler for your users.

We recommend using manual credential refresh:

- as a backup method if automatic in-app refresh fails
- if [user doesn’t meet ID requirement, fraud - check this]
