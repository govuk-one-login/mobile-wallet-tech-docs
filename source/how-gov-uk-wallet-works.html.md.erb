# What GOV.UK One Login digital wallet does, and how it works


**GOV.UK One Login digital wallet** is a new way for UK government departments or organisations to exchange documents with their users.

The digital wallet is a part of the GOV.UK One Login mobile app, which has a native version on both iOS and Android. It lets users store digital versions of letters, entitlements, certificates and other documents that are created when they use government services. Examples include digital HM Armed Forces Veteran Cards issued by MOD, digital National Insurance cards issued by HMRC, or digital disclosure certificates issued by DBS.

Users will soon be able to share digital versions of documents with other government services, instead of filling out online forms or uploading files. GOV.UK One Login digital wallet accepts digital documents in the format of [W3C verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) (VC).

**Your team or department can start issuing VCs to GOV.UK One Login digital wallet by following this documentation.**
