# What GOV.UK Wallet does, and how it works

GOV.UK Wallet is a new way for UK government departments or organisations to exchange documents with their users.

The digital wallet is a part of a mobile app, which has a native version on both iOS and Android. It lets users store digital versions of letters, entitlements, certificates and other documents that are created when they use government services that have migrated to One Login.

Users will soon be able to share digital versions of documents with other government services, instead of filling out online forms or uploading files. GOV.UK Wallet accepts digital documents in the format of [W3C verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) (VC).

Your team or department can start issuing VCs to GOV.UK Wallet by following this documentation.
