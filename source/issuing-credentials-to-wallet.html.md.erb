# Issuing credentials to GOV.UK Wallet

GOV.UK Wallet will support multiple credential formats to represent government documents. These documents can be: 

- [mdoc-based credentials for the digital driving licence ](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec:18013:-5:ed-1:v1:en)
- other Verifiable Credentials (VCs), including [W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) and later [other formats allowing selective disclosure of attributes](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/)

GOV.UK Wallet follows the [OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OIDC4VCI)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) open standard for its issuance flow.

Your team or department can start issuing credentials to GOV.UK Wallet by following this documentation.

### User authenticates with GOV.UK One Login to use your service

There is [more guidance on authenticating users with GOV.UK One Login](/issue-a-credential/authenticate-users/#authenticate-users-with-one-login)

<ol>
  <li>Your user accesses your service.</li>

  <li>Your service authenticates the user with GOV.UK One Login.</li>

  <li>Your service fetches the user’s <code>walletSubjectId</code> from the GOV.UK One Login <a href="https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/integrate-with-integration-environment/authenticate-your-user/#retrieve-user-information"><code>/userinfo</code> endpoint</a>.</li>
</ol>

There's detailed guidance on [how GOV.UK One Login works](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/how-gov-uk-one-login-works/) in the GOV.UK One Login technical documentation.

### Your service issues a credential offer

There's more guidance on [generating and issuing a credential offer](/issue-a-credential/credential-offer/#credential-offer).

[//]: # (TODO:: look into making orderd lists contine in mark-down as per https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#lists example 272)

<ol start="4">
  <li>Your service generates a credential offer that includes a <a href="/issue-a-credential/credential-offer/#the-pre-authorised-code">pre-authorised code</a> signed by your service.</li>

  <li>Your service renders the credential offer to the user as a QR code or deep-link.</li>

  <li>The user opens the app.</li>

  <li>The app prompts the user to authenticate with GOV.UK One Login.</li>

  <li>The user who authenticated with your service in a web browser is authenticated with GOV.UK One Login in the app.</li>

  <li>The user scans the QR code or opens the deep link. This action passes the credential offer to GOV.UK Wallet.</li>
</ol>

### Your service publishes metadata about the credentials it publishes

There is more guidance on [publishing your metadata](issue-a-credential/metadata).

<ol start="10">
  <li>GOV.UK Wallet sends a <code>GET</code> request to your <code>/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer</code> endpoint to fetch your metadata.</li>

  <li>Your service returns its metadata.</li>

  <li>GOV.UK Wallet calls GOV.UK One Login to exchange the pre-authorised code in the credential offer for an access token.</li>

  <li>GOV.UK One Login sends a <code>GET</code> request to your <code>/.well-known/jwks.json<code></code> endpoint to fetch your public keys, which verify the signature on the pre-authorised code issued by your service.</li>

  <li>Your service returns its public keys as a <a href="issue-a-credential/jwks">JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)</a>.</li>

  <li>GOV.UK One Login verifies the pre-authorised code content and its signature.</li>

  <li>GOV.UK One Login issues an access token that you can trust when GOV.UK Wallet calls your service to redeem it.</li>

  <li>GOV.UK Wallet generates a <a href="issue-a-credential/credential/#request-body">proof of possession</a> for the key material.</li>

  <li>GOV.UK Wallet sends a <code>POST</code> request to your <code>/credential</code> endpoint to request the credential. This request includes the access token issued by GOV.UK One Login (as a bearer token in the authorization header) and the proof of possession generated by GOV.UK Wallet. </li>
</ol>

### Your service issues a credential

There is more guidance on [issuing a credential](/issue-a-credential/credential/#credential).

<ol start="19">
  <li>Your service sends a <code>GET</code> request to the GOV.UK One Login <code>/.well-known/jwks.json</code> to fetch its public keys, which verify the signature on the access token issued by GOV.UK One Login.</li>

  <li>GOV.UK One Login returns its public keys as a JWKS.</li>

  <li>Your service verifies the content and signature of the access token and the proof of possession.</li>

  <li>Your service compares the <code>walletSubjectId</code> in the access token’s <code>sub</code> claim with the <code>walletSubjectId</code> retrieved in step 3. If they are the same, this provides assurance that you are issuing the credential to a digital wallet that is logged in as the rightful holder.</li>

  <li>Your service builds and signs the credential, and <a href="issue-a-credential/credential/#further-guidance-on-credential-binding">binds it to the <code>did:key</code> provided in the proof of possession</a> to make sure the credential can only be used by the device it is issued to.</li>

  <li>Your service returns the device-bound credential to GOV.UK Wallet.</li>

  <li>GOV.UK Wallet sends a <code>GET</code> request to your <code>/.well-known/did.json</code> endpoint to fetch your <a href="issue-a-credential/did">decentralised identifiers (DID) document</a>. The DID document contains your public key which is required to verify the signature on the credential issued by your service.</li>

  <li>Your service returns its DID document to GOV.UK Wallet.</li>

  <li>GOV.UK Wallet verifies the content and signature of the credential.</li>

  <li>GOV.UK Wallet stores the credential.</li>
</ol>

### GOV.UK Wallet notifies your service

There is more guidance on [how GOV.UK Wallet notifies your service](/issue-a-credential/notification/).

The following steps are optional. If you do not offer a `/notification` endpoint then GOV.UK Wallet will not send a notification.

<ol start="29">
  <li>GOV.UK Wallet sends a <code>POST</code> request to your <code>/notification</code> endpoint to notify your service. This notification will confirm whether GOV.UK Wallet successfully stored the credential, or failed to store it.</li>

  <li>Your service records the notification.</li>

  <li>Your service returns an empty response to GOV.UK Wallet.</li>
</ol>
