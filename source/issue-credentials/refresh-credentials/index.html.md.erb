# Refresh credentials

Digital credentials in GOV.UK Wallet have a technical expiry date, which is when the digital version of a user's credential is no longer valid and must be updated. You can set this technical expiry date using the [`validUntil` claim](/issue-a-credential/credential/#payload) in the credential. There is [more guidance on credential expiration](/issue-a-credential/credential/#guidance-on-credential-expiration).

When a credential passes its `validUntil` date, it will fail programmatic verification and must be rejected by anyone who verifies it. The user will see their expired credential marked as 'Invalid' and greyed out in the app. 

GOV.UK Wallet lets your users get a new credential without going through the longer credential issuance journey they used the first time it was issued. This is the manual credential refresh journey.

## Update credential issuer metadata

To let your users manually refresh a credential, you must add the [`credential_refresh_web_journey_url` parameter](../issue-a-credential/metadata/#credential-information) to your credential issuer metadata. This is a custom parameter that is not part of the OID4VCI specification.

`credential_refresh_web_journey_url` lets you specify a URL that jumps the user close to the end of the credential issuance journey. If this parameter is present in your metadata, your users will get a prompt to refresh when their credential passes its `validUntil` date.

When your user taps the 'Refresh' button in the app, the app will take the user to your specified URL to start their credential refresh web journey in their browser. At the end of this journey you must provide a new credential offer that GOV.UK Wallet can use to request a new credential. 

You must also include the `credential_validity_period_max_days` parameter to set a maximum validity period after which the credential must be refreshed. When you include this parameter, GOV.UK Wallet will display the value on the refresh page so that users know how often they need to refresh their document.

You must get the information about the user's existing credential from their user record. GOV.UK Wallet does not share any details about the user when they start your manual refresh journey.

If GOV.UK Wallet adds the new credential successfully, the user will only see the new credential in their documents. GOV.UK Wallet will remove the old credential.

## Understand GOV.UK Wallet's manual credential refresh flow

This diagram shows the exchange between a government service (the 'credential issuer') and GOV.UK Wallet when the user refreshes a credential. This diagram, and the descriptions below it, are an explanation of each step in the process.

1. Your user opens the app and finds the credential they need to refresh.

2. GOV.UK Wallet sends a GET request to your `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer` endpoint to fetch your credential issuer metadata.

3. Your service returns its credential issuer metadata.

4. The app finds the [`credential_refresh_web_journey_url`](../issue-a-credential/metadata/#credential-information) value in the credential issuer metadata.

5. The app validates the `credential_refresh_web_journey_url`.

6. The user selects the 'Refresh' button in the app.

7. The app opens the issuer's `credential_refresh_web_journey_url` in a browser on the user's mobile device.

When the user's browser has loaded your `credential_refresh_web_journey_url`, your service should:

1. Authenticate the user with GOV.UK One Login.

2. Determine if the user's credential can be reissued.

3. Reissue the user's credential through [the credential issuance process](../issue-credentials#user-authenticates-with-gov-uk-one-login-to-use-your-service).
