# Use Status List Service to change credential status

The Status List Service keeps a record of the status of all credentials issued to GOV.UK Wallet that include status list functionality.

The Status List Service provides:

* an issuer-facing API that credential issuers can use to issue a status list entry to a credential, and revoke it when required
* a set of public-facing credential status lists that anyone can use to check a credential's status

As a credential issuer, you can use [the issuer-facing API](issue-status-list-entry) to request a unique `uri` and `index` which can be embedded into a new credential when you issue it to GOV.UK Wallet. The `uri` and `index` refer to a unique slot in one of the Status List Service's status lists, where your credential's status will be stored. You can then [set the status of this issued status list slot as `revoked`](revoke-credential) if you need to revoke a credential in future.

Anyone, including credential verifiers and holders, can use the [public-facing status lists](statuslist) to get a single status list and check the status of a credential it contains.

In this section you can find information about:

* what to do [before you issue a status record](before-issuing-status-record)
* [issuing a status record](issue-status-list-entry/)
* [revoking a credential](revoke-credential/)
* [checking a credential's status](statuslist/)
