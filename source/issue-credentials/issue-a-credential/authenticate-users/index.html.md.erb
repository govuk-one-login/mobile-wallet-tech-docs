# Authenticate users with GOV.UK One Login

If your service wants to issue credentials you must use GOV.UK One Login to authenticate your users. This process makes sure that credentials are issued into a user’s wallet that is logged in as the same user the credential is for.

When registering your service with GOV.UK One Login, you get a unique client identifier. You must include this identifier as a `clientId` claim in the pre-authorised code your service generates as part of issuing a credential offer.

There is more guidance on [issuing a credential offer](/issue-a-credential/credential-offer).

When your user authenticates with GOV.UK One Login, you obtain their user information which includes their GOV.UK Wallet subject identifier (`walletSubjectId`). This subject identifier is a pairwise identifier you can use to carry out a rightful holder check at the point where you issue the digital credential. This check makes sure that the user logged in to your service and GOV.UK Wallet are the same user.
