This documentation is for workers in government departments who are or who will soon be using GOV.UK One Login to authenticate and verify the identity of their users. This documentation will help people such as developers and product managers of services that have migrated to GOV.UK One Login to:

* learn how to send digital credentials to their users' digital wallets, and in particular GOV.UK Wallet

* understand how GOV.UK Wallet works

The technical documentation for GOV.UK Wallet is currently available only for government services who are looking into sharing credentials with the wallet.
