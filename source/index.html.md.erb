# Who this documentation is for

This documentation is for workers in government departments who are or who will soon be using One Login to authenticate and verify the identity of their users. This documentation will help developers, product managers of services that have migrated to One Login to:

* learn how to send digital credentials to their users' digital wallets, and in particular GOV.UK One Login digital wallet

* understand how GOV.UK One Login digital wallet works

The technical documentation for GOV.UK One Login digital wallet is currently only available to government services who intend to use the wallet, but will be publicly available for other government services to use in the future.
