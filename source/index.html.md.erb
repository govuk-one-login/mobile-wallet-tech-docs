# GOV.UK Wallet technical documentation

GOV.UK Wallet lets users save and share digital versions of their government documents on their smartphone or device.

If you work in a central government department, you can use GOV.UK Wallet to [issue digital and verifiable versions of the physical documents you already issue](#issuing-a-document-as-a-government-service) as part of your service.

You will be able to [consume credentials from GOV.UK Wallet](#using-and-consuming-a-document) if you are a: 

* public sector organisation (such as central government, the NHS, or a local authority) 
* certified Digital Verification Services (DVS) provider on the [digital identity and attribute services register](https://www.digital-identity-services-register.service.gov.uk/)

## Issuing a document as a government service

Before you can issue credentials to GOV.UK Wallet, you must already be using [GOV.UK One Login](https://www.sign-in.service.gov.uk/) in your service to log in your users or verify their identities. You should discuss using GOV.UK Wallet with your GOV.UK One Login Engagement Manager, or [contact us](contact-us).

## Using and consuming a document 

You will be able to consume credentials from GOV.UK Wallet if you are: 

* a public sector organisation (such as central government, the NHS, or a local authority) 
* a certified Digital Verification Services (DVS) provider on the [digital identity and attribute services register](https://www.digital-identity-services-register.service.gov.uk/)
