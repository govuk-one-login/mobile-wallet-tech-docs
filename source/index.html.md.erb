# GOV.UK Wallet

GOV.UK Wallet lets users save and share digital versions of their government documents on their smartphone or device.

If you work in a central government department, you can issue a digitally verifiable credential to add a document to GOV.UK Wallet as part of your service. 

Before you can issue credentials to GOV.UK Wallet, you must already be using [GOV.UK One Login](https://www.sign-in.service.gov.uk/) in your service to log in your users or verify their identities. You should discuss using GOV.UK Wallet with your GOV.UK One Login Engagement Manager.

This documentation helps people such as developers and product managers of services that are using GOV.UK One Login to:

* understand [how GOV.UK Wallet works for credential issuers](how-gov-uk-wallet-works)
* learn [how to issue digital credentials to GOV.UK Wallet](credential-issuer-functionality) as part of their service journey
