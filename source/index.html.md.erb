# GOV.UK Wallet

GOV.UK Wallet lets users save and share digital versions of their government documents on their smartphone or device.

## Issuing a document as a government service

If you work in a central government department, you can use GOV.UK Wallet to issue digital and verifiable versions of the physical documents you issue already as part of your service.  

Before you can issue credentials to GOV.UK Wallet, you must already be using [GOV.UK One Login](https://www.sign-in.service.gov.uk/) in your service to log in your users or verify their identities. You should discuss using GOV.UK Wallet with your GOV.UK One Login Engagement Manager, or [contact us](contact-us).

This documentation helps people such as developers and product managers of services that are using GOV.UK One Login to:

* learn how to issue digitally verifiable credentials to GOV.UK Wallet as part of their service journey 
* understand [how GOV.UK Wallet works for credential issuers](issuing-credentials-to-wallet)
* [prepare your service to use GOV.UK Wallet](before-integrating)
* understand [how organisations and individuals can receive and validate digital credentials you have issued](consuming-and-verifying-credentials) when presented by the holder

## Using and consuming a document 

You will be able to consume credentials from GOV.UK Wallet if you are: 

* a public sector organisation (such as central government, the NHS, or a local authority) 
* a certified Digital Verification Services (DVS) provider on the [digital identity and attribute services register](https://www.digital-identity-services-register.service.gov.uk/)

This documentation helps developers and service teams in these organisations to:

* understand [how GOV.UK wallet works for consuming credentials](consuming-and-verifying-credentials)
* understand the [open standards that will allow their service to consume and verify credentials and attributes](consuming-and-verifying-credentials/supported-protocols)

This documentation will be updated as new information and features become available. 

Digital verification services should read the guidance about [using GOV.UK Wallet in the digital identity sector](https://gov.uk/guidance/using-govuk-wallet-in-the-digital-identity-sector)​​ to understand the different models available.
