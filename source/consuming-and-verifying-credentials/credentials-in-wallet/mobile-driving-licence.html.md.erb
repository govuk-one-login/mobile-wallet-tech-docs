# Mobile driving licence

You will be able to verify information about a user based on the details held in their mobile driving licence (mDL). You can choose the attributes required to fit your verification process from the [ISO 18013-5 standard](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec:18013:-5:ed-1:v1:en). You can also include additional [UK-specific attributes](#uk-specific-attributes) which DVLA provides in their mDL.

You will be able to see an example of an mDL verifier using our [reference implementation](consuming-and-verifying-credentials/use-sample-reference-material).
