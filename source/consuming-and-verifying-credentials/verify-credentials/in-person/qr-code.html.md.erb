# Read GOV.UK Wallet QR codes for in person flows

Before you begin your verification process, you must establish a connection with the device holding the credential. This is known as device engagement.

To establish a connection successfully you must be able to:

- read an [ISO/IEC 18004](https://www.iso.org/standard/83389.html) standard [QR code](#qr-code)
- act in the [client role, using the Bluetooth GATT protocol](./data-retrieval)
- support Curve P-256 for ECDH/ECDSA session encryption

There is more guidance available on the [in-person sharing flow](./#understand-gov-uk-wallet-s-in-person-sharing-flow).

## Device data shared in a GOV.UK Wallet QR code

GOV.UK Wallet will use a QR code to begin device engagement using the [ISO/IEC 18013-5](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec:18013:-5:ed-1:v1:en) standard. GOV.UK Wallet does not currently support other device engagement technologies, such as Near Field Communication (NFC).  

When prompted by a user to share a credential, GOV.UK Wallet will generate the QR code for you to read.

### Personally identifiable information

The QR code will allow you to request a secure connection to the user's device.  You will use this connection to request credential attributes you wish to use in your verification process.  

The QR code does not contain any personally identifiable information about the user.

## QR code URL

GOV.UK Wallet will share information you need to configure the data sharing flow, when you read the generated QR code.  This is in the form of a Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) containing details such as:

- GOV.UK Wallet's public key
- encryption methods used in the sharing flow
- instructions for [how to configure your bluetooth session](device-request.html).

When you read a QR code generated by GOV.UK Wallet, you will receive the information as the base64 URL encoded CBOR.  This will be in the format of `mdoc:{URL_ENCODED_CBOR}`.

This is an example of a QR code URL:

```
mdoc:owBjMS4wAYIB2BhYS6QgAQECIVgg_3....
```
