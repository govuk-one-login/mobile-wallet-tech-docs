# Use sample reference material

The GOV.UK Wallet team is developing test frameworks and sample reference material to help you verify credentials stored in GOV.UK Wallet.

## In-person verification

The GOV.UK Wallet team is building a reference implementation for in-person credential verification. This reference implementation will show you how you could build a credential verifier that follows the [ISO 13018-5 standard](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec:18013:-5:ed-1:v1:en). More details on this reference implementation will be added in future.
