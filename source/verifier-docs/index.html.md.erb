# Consuming and using credentials in GOV.UK Wallet

GOV.UK Wallet will allow GOV.UK One Login users to store and present digital versions of government-issued documents on their phones.

Government departments will [issue cryptographically verifiable credentials to a user’s GOV.UK Wallet](how-gov-uk-wallet-works). The user’s credentials are linked to their GOV.UK One Login account and to their personal device, and cannot be moved to another device.

By connecting with GOV.UK Wallet, credential consumers can digitally verify the credentials they receive.

## Presenting credentials using GOV.UK Wallet

A GOV.UK Wallet user will be able to present their credentials to a service, third party, or business that wants to verify and consume them. 

GOV.UK Wallet will let users present their credentials:

* in-person, for example to prove their age when purchasing age-restricted products
* online, to share documents with a service securely instead of uploading a photo or a PDF

GOV.UK Wallet will use [standard protocols to offer flexible verification scenarios](verifier-docs/supported-protocols).

## Trusted list

GOV.UK Wallet will put mechanisms in place to make sure personal data from users is shared only with trusted parties. This will mitigate the risk of malicious apps or services accessing credential data without the user’s knowledge.

GOV.UK One Login will use trusted lists to identify consumers of credentials and protect user data. Further details on this functionality will be added in future.

## Data flows

### Data flow between credential issuers, holders and verifiers

GOV.UK Wallet is built in three parts to connect government departments (credential issuers), users (credential holders) and verifiers requesting data (credential verifiers).

<%= image_tag "general-data-flow.png", { :alt => '' } %>

#### 1. Government department

Government departments (issuers) issue digital and verifiable versions of physical documents (credentials) to a user’s GOV.UK Wallet. For example, a government department could issue a credential containing a user’s date of birth that proves their age.

#### 2. GOV.UK Wallet

The credential holder (the user the credential refers to) uses GOV.UK Wallet to store, manage and present their credentials online and in person. For example, a user could store a credential containing their date of birth, and present this when they need to prove their age.

#### 3. Verifier service

Credential consumers can use a verifier service to digitally verify a holder’s credentials. For example, a merchant selling age-restricted products could use a verifier service to request and digitally verify a customer’s proof of age.

### Using GOV.UK Wallet in person

#### ISO 18013-5 supervised proximity flow

In this example, a user is purchasing age-restricted products in person. They have a valid digital driving licence stored on their personal device in GOV.UK Wallet.

The merchant selling the products (the verifier) wants to verify the user’s age, and is using a device with a verifier app installed. The verifier app is from a [UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version/trust-framework-certification) (UK DIATF) certified provider.

The data flow for this interaction is as follows.

1. The verifier asks the user to show proof of their age.
1. The user opens the GOV.UK One Login app.
1. To open GOV.UK Wallet, the user authenticates themselves with GOV.UK One Login and uses the device’s local authentication (FaceID, fingerprint, PIN or pattern).
1. The verifier app on the verifier’s device is configured to request data from the user’s digital driving licence. For this transaction, the data requested is a proof of age and a photograph.
1. GOV.UK Wallet generates a QR code on the user’s device, which the user shows to the verifier to begin the verification process.
1. The verifier scans the QR code using the verifier app.
1. GOV.UK Wallet checks that the verifier app is a DIATF certified provider.
1. The user reviews the data that was requested, consents to share it, and allows it to be shared with the verifier app.
1. The verifier app checks the data’s authenticity, origin and validity.
1. The verifier app shows the verifier a visual confirmation of the user’s proof of age, including a photograph.

### Using GOV.UK Wallet online

#### OID4VP same device flow

In this example, a user is purchasing an age-restricted product online using an app or the browser on their phone. This is the same phone where their credentials are held in GOV.UK Wallet. The user holds a credential that would prove their age in GOV.UK Wallet.

The website selling the product (the relying party website) must get proof of the user’s age before completing the transaction. The relying party website is using a DVS on the DIATF framework.

<%= image_tag "OID4VP-same-device.png", { :alt => '' } %>

The data flow for this interaction is as follows.

1. During their purchase, the user goes to a screen that asks them to connect with GOV.UK Wallet to prove their age.
1. The digital verification service (DVS) used by the relying party’s website is configured to generate a specific credential request. In this example, the credential request would include a photograph of the user and a confirmation that they are above the age needed to complete the transaction.
1. The relying party’s website displays the credential request to the user as a deep link.
1. The user taps the link, which opens the GOV.UK One Login app.
1. To open GOV.UK Wallet, the user authenticates themselves with GOV.UK One Login and uses the device’s local authentication (FaceID, fingerprint, PIN or pattern).
1. The relying party website passes the request to the DVS.
1. The DVS requests the data it needs from GOV.UK Wallet. In this example, the data would be a photograph of the user and a confirmation that they are above the age needed to complete the transaction.
1. GOV.UK Wallet checks that the DVS provider is DIATF certified.
1. The user reviews the data that was requested, consents to share it, and allows it to be shared with the DVS and the relying party.
1. The DVS checks the data’s authenticity, origin and validity.
1. The relying party website shows a visual confirmation of the credential verification. If the verification was successful and the user has proven their age, they can continue with the transaction.

#### OID4VP cross device flow

In this example, the user holds a credential that would prove their age in GOV.UK Wallet on their phone. The user is purchasing an age-restricted product online using a separate device (for example, a laptop).

The website selling the product (the relying party website) must get proof of the user’s age before completing the transaction. The relying party website is using a DVS on the DIATF framework.

<%= image_tag "OID4VP-cross-device.png", { :alt => '' } %>

The data flow for this interaction is as follows.

1. During the purchase on their laptop, the user goes to a screen that asks them to connect with GOV.UK Wallet to prove their age.
1. To open GOV.UK Wallet on their phone, the user authenticates themselves with GOV.UK One Login and uses the device’s local authentication (FaceID, fingerprint, PIN or pattern).
1. The digital verification service (DVS) used by the relying party’s website is configured to generate a specific credential request. In this example, the request would include a photograph of the user and a confirmation that they are above the age needed to complete the transaction.
1. The relying party’s website displays the credential request to the user as a QR code.
1. The user scans the QR code using GOV.UK Wallet on their phone.
1. The relying party website passes the request to the DVS.
1. The DVS requests the data it needs from GOV.UK Wallet. In this example, the data would be a photograph of the user and a confirmation that they are above the age needed to complete the transaction.
1. GOV.UK Wallet checks that the DVS provider is one of the DIATF certified providers.
1. The user reviews the data that was requested, consents to share it, and allows it to be shared with the DVS and the relying party.
1. The DVS checks the data’s authenticity, origin and validity.
1. The relying party website shows a visual confirmation of the credential verification. If verification was successful and the user has proven their age, they can continue with their purchase.
