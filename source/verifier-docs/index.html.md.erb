# Consuming and verifying credentials in GOV.UK Wallet

GOV.UK Wallet will allow GOV.UK One Login users to store and present digital versions of government-issued documents on their phones.

Government departments will [issue cryptographically verifiable credentials to a user’s GOV.UK Wallet](issuing-credentials-to-wallet). The user’s credentials are linked to their GOV.UK One Login account and to their personal device, and cannot be moved to another device.

GOV.UK Wallet will enable:

* government departments and other public sector organisations to consume and verify credentials or attributes 
* digital verification services, certified under the trust framework, to verify credentials or attributes on behalf of businesses in the private sector (known as relying parties) 

In the private sector a relying party, such as an online store, will need to use a digital verification service to use documents from GOV.UK Wallet.

<b>This technical documentation will be updated as new information and features are available. We welcome feedback from partners and industry on our documentation - find out how to [contact us](contact-us).</b>

## Sharing credentials using GOV.UK Wallet

A GOV.UK Wallet user will be able to share their credentials with a trusted credential consumer, or verifier. 

GOV.UK Wallet will let users share their credentials:

* in-person, for example to prove their age when purchasing age-restricted products
* online, to share documents with a service securely instead of uploading a photo or a PDF

GOV.UK Wallet will use [standard protocols to offer flexible verification scenarios](verifier-docs/supported-protocols).

## Trusted list

GOV.UK Wallet will put mechanisms in place to make sure personal data from users is shared only with trusted parties. This will mitigate the risk of malicious apps or services accessing credential data without the user’s knowledge.

GOV.UK One Login will use trusted lists to identify consumers of credentials and protect user data. Further details on this functionality will be added in future.

Where the credential consumer is outside of government, GOV.UK Wallet will only release credentials to digital verification services (DVS) which are certified against the trust framework and appear on the DVS register.

## Data flows

### Data flow between credential issuers, holders and verifiers

GOV.UK Wallet is built in three parts to connect government departments (credential issuers), users (credential holders) and verifiers requesting data (credential verifiers).

<%= image_tag "wallet-trust-model.png", { :alt => '' } %>

#### 1. Government department

Government departments (issuers) issue digital and verifiable versions of physical documents (credentials) to a user’s GOV.UK Wallet. For example, a government department could issue a credential containing a user’s date of birth that proves their age.

#### 2. GOV.UK Wallet

The credential holder (the user the credential refers to) uses GOV.UK Wallet to store, manage and present their credentials online and in person. For example, a user could store a credential containing their date of birth, and present this when they need to prove their age.

#### 3. Verification service

Government departments and the public sector can act as a verifier. 

A DVS certified against the [UK digital identity and attributes trust framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework), and added to the [digital identity and attribute services register](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-registered-digital-identity-and-attribute-services), can access GOV.UK Wallet. For example, a merchant (as a relying party) selling age-restricted products could use a registered digital verification service to request and digitally verify a customer’s proof of age. 

### Using GOV.UK Wallet in person

#### ISO 18013-5 supervised proximity flow

In this example, a user is purchasing age-restricted products in person and sharing their information with a business. They have a valid digital driving licence stored on their personal device in GOV.UK Wallet.

The merchant selling the products (the relying party) wants to verify the user’s age, and is using a device with a verifier app (the verification service) installed. To work with GOV.UK Wallet, the verifier app must be from a [UK digital identity and attributes trust framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version/trust-framework-certification) certified provider on the [digital identity and attribute services register](https://www.digital-identity-services-register.service.gov.uk/) (DVS register).

<%= image_tag "ISO-proximity.png", { :alt => '' } %>

The data flow for this interaction is as follows.

1. The relying party asks the user to show proof of their age.
1. The user who wants to prove their age opens the GOV.UK One Login app.
1. To open GOV.UK Wallet, the user authenticates themselves with GOV.UK One Login and uses the device’s local authentication (face, fingerprint, PIN or pattern).
1. The verifier app on the relying party’s device is configured to request data from the user’s digital driving licence. For this transaction, the data requested is a proof of age and a photograph.
1. GOV.UK Wallet generates a QR code on the user’s device, which the user shows to the relying party to begin the verification process.
1. The relying party scans the QR code using the verifier app.
1. GOV.UK Wallet checks that the verifier app is a trust framework certified and DVS registered provider.
1. The user reviews the data that was requested (for example an over 18 attribute and photograph), consents to share it, and allows it to be shared with the verifier app.
1. The verifier app checks the data’s authenticity, origin and validity.
1. The verifier app shows the relying party a visual confirmation of the user’s proof of age, including a photograph.

### Using GOV.UK Wallet online

#### OID4VP same device flow

In this example, a user is purchasing an age-restricted product online using an app or the browser on their phone. This is the same phone where their credentials are held in GOV.UK Wallet. The user holds a credential that would prove their age (for example, a digital driving licence) in GOV.UK Wallet.

The website selling the product (the relying party website) must get proof of the user’s age before completing the transaction. To work with GOV.UK Wallet, the relying party website must use a registered DVS certified against the trust framework.

<%= image_tag "OID4VP-same-device.png", { :alt => '' } %>

The data flow for this interaction is as follows.

1. During their purchase, the user goes to a screen that asks them to connect to a digital identity service to prove their age. The user selects GOV.UK Wallet.
1. The digital verification service (DVS) used by the relying party’s website is configured to generate a specific credential request. In this example, the credential request would include a photograph of the user and a confirmation that they are above the age needed to complete the transaction.
1. The relying party’s website displays the credential request to the user as a deep link.
1. The user taps the link, which opens the GOV.UK One Login app.
1. To open GOV.UK Wallet, the user authenticates themselves with GOV.UK One Login and uses the device’s local authentication (face, fingerprint, PIN or pattern).
1. The relying party website passes the request to the DVS.
1. The DVS requests the data it needs from GOV.UK Wallet. In this example, the data would be a photograph of the user and a confirmation that they are above the age needed to complete the transaction.
1. GOV.UK Wallet checks that the DVS provider is trust framework certified and appears on the DVS register.
1. The user reviews the data that was requested, consents to share it, and allows it to be shared with the DVS and the relying party.
1. The DVS checks the data’s authenticity, origin and validity.
1. The relying party website shows a visual confirmation of the credential verification. If the verification was successful and the user has proven their age, they can continue with the transaction.

#### OID4VP cross device flow

In this example, the user holds a credential that would prove their age (for example, a digital driving licence) in GOV.UK Wallet on their phone. The user is purchasing an age-restricted product online using a separate device (for example, a laptop).

The website selling the product (the relying party website) must get proof of the user’s age before completing the transaction. The relying party website is using a registered DVS certified against the trust framework.
