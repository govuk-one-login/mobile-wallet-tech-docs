# Use sample reference material

You can use our test harness and sample reference data to help you issue credentials to GOV.UK Wallet correctly.

## Test harness

You can use the [GOV.UK Wallet test harness](https://github.com/govuk-one-login/mobile-wallet-cri-test-harness) to validate your credential issuance implementation.

Follow the instructions in the README files to run the test scripts on your credential issuer.

## Example credential issuer

You can use the [credential issuer service in Java](https://github.com/govuk-one-login/mobile-wallet-example-credential-issuer) to see an example of a credential issuer service integrated with GOV.UK Wallet.

Follow the instructions in the README files to run an example of the credential issuance flow.
