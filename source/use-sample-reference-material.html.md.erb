# Use sample reference material

You can use the [credential issuer service in Java integrated with GOV.UK One Login](https://github.com/govuk-one-login/mobile-wallet-example-credential-issuer) to see an example of a credential issuer service integrated with the GOV.UK Wallet.

Follow the instructions in the README files to run an example of the credential issuance flow.
