# Publish your metadata

The metadata endpoint provides essential configuration information about a credential issuer’s implementation. To issue credentials, you must publish your metadata endpoint so that GOV.UK Wallet and verifiers can learn information about your credential issuer, such as:

- the endpoints used in your issuance flow
- the supported credential types
- how your credentials should be displayed

## Technical details

### Endpoint location

Your metadata must be publicly accessible at the standardised location on your credential issuer domain: `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer.` The data published is non-sensitive metadata about your service.

### Response format

The endpoint must return a `200 OK` HTTP status code and valid JSON response that follows the [OID4VCI specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-metadata).

Your metadata must include the following parameters:

| Parameter                             | Description                                                                                                                                      | 
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| `credential_issuer`                   | The URL of the credential issuer.                                                                                                                | 
| `authorization_servers`               | An array of URLs for the authorization servers your credential issuer relies on for authorization. This must be set to the GOV.UK One Login URL. | 
| `credential_endpoint`                 | The URL of your credential issuer’s [credential endpoint](/issue-a-credential/credential/#credential), where credentials can be obtained.        |
| `credential_configurations_supported` | An object [describing the credentials](#credential-information) offered by your credential issuer.                                               |

If your credential issuer implements the optional [notification endpoint](/issue-a-credential/notification/#notification), then the metadata must include the `notification_endpoint` parameter.

You can define and use additional metadata parameters.

#### Credential information

The `credential_configurations_supported` object contains key-value pairs, where:

- each key is a unique identifier of a verifiable credential supported by the credential issuer
- each value is the configuration of that verifiable credential

Each credential object in `credential_configurations_supported` must include the following parameters:

| Parameter                                 | Description                                                                                  | 
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| `format`                                  | Format of the credential.                                                                    |
| `credential_definition`                   | Description of the credential type.                                                          |
| `cryptographic_binding_methods_supported` | Set of methods available for cryptographically binding the issued credential.                |
| `credential_signing_alg_values_supported` | Set of algorithms that the credential issuer uses to sign the credential.                    |
| `proof_types_supported`                   | Key proof(s) supported by the credential issuer.                                             |
| `credential_refresh_web_journey_url`      | The URL where your users can go through the credential refresh web journey in their browser. |
| `credential_validity_period_max_days`     | The credential’s validity period in days once it’s issued.                                   |

GOV.UK Wallet also requires your credential issuer’s metadata to support English and Welsh translation.

#### Credential expiry

Your metadata endpoint response must include the following custom parameters:

- `credential_refresh_web_journey_url`
- `credential_validity_period_max_days`

You must set `credential_refresh_web_journey_url` to the URL where your users can go through the credential refresh web journey in their browser. The `credential_validity_period_max_days` specifies the credential's validity period in days once it's issued. 

If the credential's `validUntil` date or `expiryDate` ends before your specified validity period, then the credential will expire earlier. For example, if you set `credential_validity_period_max_days` to 90 days but the credential's `expiryDate` will pass in 30 days' time, then the credential will only be valid for 30 days.

More information about [refreshing credentials](../../refresh-credentials/) is available.
