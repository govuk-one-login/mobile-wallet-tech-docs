# RFC 00XX Token Status lists

## Background
GOV.UK One Login is developing a government wallet - GOV.UK One Login digital wallet - to enable users to acquire, view and share digital versions of government-issued credentials.

## Requirements

GOV.UK One Login or an issuer may want to revoke credential(s) they have issued.

- The revocation may be permanent or temporary depending on the scenario.
- The revocation must support at least 4 statuses, Valid, Invalid, Suspended and Application specific.
- The revocation mechanism must be secure, privacy and scaleable to millions of records.

Some example scenarios are 

- Revoking a driving license as a result of disqualification.
- Issuance of a new licence to replace a learning licence.

## Scope

This RFC builds on the [IETF Oauth Status List RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-status-list/06/) and focuses on the use of status list to provide up to date statuses for the GOV.UK One Login wallet issuer, holder and verifier.
